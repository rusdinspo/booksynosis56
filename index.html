A Whole New Approach to Your Body, Brain, and Life as a gURL</h2><p><b>Deal With It! </b>offers a whole new approach for dealing with your life as a girl. It's a resource to help you learn about, laugh about, and figure out the stuff you go through on your way through life. It won't tell you what to do, because you'll need to decide that for yourself. But whether you're wondering about your body, your feelings or your changing relationships with the people around you, this book provides accurate information and outlines your options. Hilarious illustrations point out the humor in even the sorriest situations. And with hundreds of excerpts from real-girl conversations on the gURL.com website, you can see for real that whatever you're going through, you're not alone. <p> This book is for anyone who needs to know what it means to be a girl -- from those on the edge of their teens to those who are way past them but still reeling from the trauma.</p></p><p>The birds and bees have never been so hip, thanks to Esther Drill, Heather McDonald, and Rebecca Odes, creators of gURL.com and authors of <i>Deal with It! A Whole New Approach to Your Body, Brain and Life as a gURL</i>. As their Web site blossomed in popularity, the gURLs noticed that today's teens have the same questions about sex, love, and growing up that they had as teens. "Hearing what they had to say convinced us that there was a need for a new kind of book about being a girl, one that's smart, funny, approachable, and tuned in to the things girls really want to know." With chapters such as "Boobs," "What's Up Down There," "To Do It or Not to Do It," and "Those Sucky Emotions," the gURLs have got everything covered--with the frankness, humor, and style frustratingly absent from the majority of similarly themed books. All topics are fair game: zit remedies; a dazzling array of hair removal techniques; masturbation methods; sexual positions and orientations; what to do if you are raped; how to deal with anger, depression, and anxiety; the physical effects of different drugs; how to get along with friends and family; and more. In addition to a cooler-than-cool, color-drenched layout and loads of detailed info, <i>Deal with It</i> includes a ton of questions, comments, and personal advice from teenage girls who frequent gURL.com. Reading page after page of these earnest, confused, and curious young voices drives home the need for a book like <i>Deal with It</i> and makes clear that the women of gURL.com have met that challenge with resounding success.

In Optical Illusions for Quilters, she unravels the mysteries of optical illusions as applied to quilting, some of them for the first time. Masterpiece quilts are used to explain each illusion and quilters are shown how to apply these principles to their work. Though Karen&#39;s focus is on quilting, these principles can be applied to other creative mediums. In an easy to understand manner, she encourages readers to use their imaginations, listen to their inner voices, and apply their new knowledge as they become masters of illusions.</p><p>Karen is known for taking a traditional pattern and giving it her own unique twist.

During the mid-eighties, the Reagan years, the Cold War was still on and fears of nuclear war were at a height not seen since the early sixties. Naturally,a slew of books came out to feed the fear. <br><br>THE LAST SHIP took that "genre" to a new level. William Brinkley is a terrific story teller, and he's also a wonderful writer. I remember reading this book and being torn between my instinct to race through the book and wanting to slow down to a near halt to admire the paragraphs and his use of the English language. (I was driven more than once to the dictionary, not that the vocabulary was instrusive in any way.)<br><br>I am heartened to see such recent comments from customers. I have seen this book reorder steadily for years, and it is terrific to read reviews from new found fans. Perhaps the nuclear testing in India and Pakistan revived the interest in books like this, but I think it is more likely that THE LAST SHIP is so well written that it has stood the test of time. <br><br>Sheila Phelan, Director of Circulation<br>able horror of total nuclear war has been let loose upon the world, and only one ship, the Nathan James, with 152 men and 26 women aboard, has survived. Her captain narrates the electryfing story of this crew's voyage through the hell of nuclear winter, their search for survivial, and the fate of mankind when they find an uncontaminated paradise.<br>"Beautifully written...A magnificent book."<br>CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER</p><h2>Black Cat, Vol. 4</h2><p>Train Heartnet was once a legendary assassin known as &#34;Black Cat&#34; and belonged to a secret society called Chronos.

Train and his partner Sven are joined by a sexy thief named Rinslet and an amazing young girl named Eve who is a creation of nanotechnology!</p><p>Lives in Japan.</p><h2>No Death, No Fear : Comforting Wisdom for Life</h2><p>Thich Nhat Hanh says: &#39;Our biggest fear is that we will become nothing when we die. If we think that we cease to exist when we die, we have not looked very deeply at ourselves.&#39; With his usual blend of stories, exquisite analogies and guided meditations, Thich Nhat Hanh takes the reader through the same examination of death, fear and the nature of existence that Buddhist monks and nuns have been performing in their meditations for 2500 years. The understanding of no death comes from exploding the myth of how we think we exist. Knowing how we actually exist produces the state of no fear. This is a new subject for Thich Nhat Hanh and many people will turn to him for his help with fear and death, just as they did for his help with anger.</p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh always invites us to look deeply, and he does so once again in <i>No Death, No Fear</i>. Recognizing interconnections, Nhat Hanh brings us to beginnings, how they depend on endings, and how they are but temporary manifestations. Everything endures, he says, but in different forms. And this isn't just a palliative to make us feel better for a while--Nhat Hanh's philosophy of Interbeing takes the long view, challenging us to open our eyes to subtle transformations. He shows how extraordinary things happen when we are fully present with others and at peace with ourselves, both of which require openness and deep looking. In his bestselling style of easy prose, compelling anecdotes, and pragmatic advice, Nhat Hanh gradually drains the force out of grief and fear, transforming them into happiness and insightful living. Death doesn't have to be a roadblock, and in <i>No Death, No Fear</i> Thich Nhat Hanh shows us the way around. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese poet, bestselling author and peace activist, has been a Buddhist monk for over 40 years. He was chairman of the Vietnamese Buddhist Peace delegation during the Vietnam War and was nominated by Dr Martin Luther King for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1966 he visited the US and Europe on a peace mission and was unable to return to his native land. Today he heads Plum Village, a meditation community in south-western France, where he teaches, writes, gardens and aids refugees worldwide.</p><h2>Logan&#39;s World (Logan Series, Book 2)</h2><p><b>Logan's world. . .</b> <p>With the computer system destroyed, Earth has reverted to savagery.

But in the ensuing centuries, some have taken this conviction as a mandate to abandon the departure from received orthodoxy, while others have progressed toward a rigid confessionalism that cements the Reformation itself as a final codification of truth. Between these extremes is the ongoing need of the church to be always reforming--subjecting its beliefs and practices to the renewed scrutiny of Holy Scripture and restating the truth of Scriptures in ways that faithfully communicate the gospel, advance the mission of the church and empower the people of God.

Of a childhood spent in the Nazi camps and her refusal to forget the past as an adult in America. &#39;It is not in our power to forgive: memory does that for us,&#39; says Kluger. Not erasing a single detail, not even the inconvenient ones, she writes frankly about the troubled relationship with her mother even through their years of internment, and of her determination not to forgive and absolve the past. It is this memory, pure and harsh, that makes Kluger&#39;s memoir so unforgettable.</p><p>Born in 1931, Ruth Kluger emigrated to America in 1947 where she is a distinguished professor of German.

But when she secretly consults on an exquisite collection for Arizona's luxurious Avalon Resorts, she doesn't know she will cross paths with enigmatic business titan J. L. Trask. <p> Years ago, Trask accused Alexa's stepfather of murder -- and vowed he would get revenge. Now, their meeting is inevitable -- and attraction immediate -- as they trade sizzling sparks and snappy repartee.

J.L. Trask--"Trask" to friends and enemies alike--has returned to Avalon, Arizona, 12 years after his father's mysterious death, to not only fulfill his dream of opening a world-class resort hotel but also to hunt down his father's killer. There he encounters none other than Alexa Chambers, stepdaughter of one of his father's former partners, whom Trask suspects of playing a role in the murder. Alexa is biding her time in Avalon, working tirelessly behind the scenes to regain her reputation as an expert in 20th-century antiques and art after having been framed in a forgery scandal that rocked the art world a year earlier. Alexa's best chance to redeem herself is by verifying the authenticity of the Art Deco collection at Trask's new hotel. Thrown together by the project, the two find it difficult to ignore the lasting animosity of a past encounter--not to mention the passionate heat they experience in each other's company. And as Trask grows ever closer to discovering who the true killer is, dark forces conspire against him, endangering not only his life but Alexa's as well.

Medium Raw explores these changes, moving back and forth from the author&#39;s bad old days to the present. Tracking his own strange and unexpected voyage from journeyman cook to globe-traveling professional eater and drinker, and even to fatherhood, Bourdain takes no prisoners as he dissects what he&#39;s seen, pausing along the way for a series of confessions, rants, investigations, and interrogations of some of the most controversial figures in food. Beginning with a secret and highly illegal after-hours gathering of powerful chefs that he compares to a mafia summit, Bourdain pulls back the curtain-but never pulls his punches-on the modern gastronomical revolution, as only he can. Cutting right to the bone, Bourdain sets his sights on some of the biggest names in the foodie world, including David Chang, the young superstar chef who has radicalized the fine-dining landscape; the revered Alice Waters, whom he treats with unapologetic frankness; the Top Chef winners and losers; and many more. And always he returns to the question &#34;Why cook?&#34; Or the more difficult &#34;Why cook well?&#34; Medium Raw is the deliciously funny and shockingly delectable journey to those answers, sure to delight philistines and gourmands alike.</p><p></p><h2>The Mushroom Book How to Identify, Gather and Cook Wild Mushrooms and Other Fungi</h2><p>Filled with photographs of prized culinary fungi and notorious poisonious specimens, this book offers advice on where, when, and how to pick and prepare edible species.</p><p>The bulk of this North American edition is a field guide to 450 mushrooms.

Roy Halston Frowick moved to Chicago at age 20 from Des Moines and with the backing of his hairdresser-lover started a millinery business that quickly gained a local following. Offered a job in New York by the famous Lilly Dache, Halston soon was installed at Bergdorf's, selling hats and charming celebrity customers (including Jacqueline Kennedy, who wore his pillbox hat for the inauguration). As the 60's progressed, Halston moved over to designing ready-to-wear. His showroom became a gathering place for the famous, and his simple, elegant clothes became all the rage, until a 1972 Newsweek cover named him America's ``premier fashion designer.'' In 1973, he sold his business to Norton Simon Industries, which created an extremely successful fragrance. But as the 70's wore on, the licensing ventures languished as Halston allegedly began to use cocaine heavily, getting in to work at noon after nights at Studio 54. When Norton Simon was taken over, the Halston division was sold several times to corporations less tolerant of the designer's disregard for the bottom line, and finally Halston himself was banished from his own offices, with others producing under the Halston name. In March 1990, the designer died of AIDS. Jam-packed with sordid detail (prostitutes, anonymous sex in Central Park, a destructive long-term lover named Victor Hugo) and celebrities (Liza, Andy, Bianca): reading this is like mainlining 70's gossip. In all: a sad story of talent gone astray and a fascinating, disturbing portrait of the imaginative decadence of the disco era. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>There's a sad irony in the glitzy life of fashion designer Roy Halston Frowick, product of a Midwestern Depression childhood with an alcoholic father and the self-made "king of New York night life." Halston, whose clean-cut, all-American style was mass-marketed through J. C. Penney, was hooked on cocaine, booze and Quaaludes and had a nasty anti-Semitic streak, as portrayed here. As his fame peaked, he became increasingly paranoid, capricious and hot-tempered, according to Gaines, author of a Beatles biography ( The Love You Make ). Halston, at the height of his fame, was "almost a caricature of a sissy homosexual fashion designer, haughty and superficial," we are told. There are candid details of his coked-out Venezuelan window-dresser lover, his endless stream of call boys, business reversals, cavortings with the rich and beautiful (Andy Warhol, Liza Minnelli et al.) and his death from AIDS in 1990 at the age of 57.

Here are the stories of two very different Irishmen, from different generations, whose lives intersect for a brief and mutually destructive time, and then continue, in misery, apart. McCabe deftly avoids the easy or dramatic ending and delivers instead the saddest, funniest, most horrible ending of all because it is so true to life.From the award-winning author of <i>The Butcher Boy</i> comes a new novel of extraordinary power that, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, "confirm[s] McCabe's standing as one of the most brilliant writers to ever come out of Ireland."<p></p><p>In <i>The Dead School</i>, Patrick McCabe returns to the emotionally dense landscape of small-town Ireland to explore the inner lives of two men: a headmaster and a schoolteacher, each man the product of a soul-stifling culture, each battling his own demons of loss and betrayal. Tension coils--until tragedy strikes a young student in their charge, and the latent despair and rage that has festered in their hearts explodes onto the page. As in <i>The Butcher Boy</i>, McCabe demonstrates his remarkable command of the vernacular and an uncanny ability to pinpoint the exact moment when ordinary minds take flight into madness.

Vernon)</h2><p>This story is told through the eyes of Bettje and Jan, children of Menno Simons, who lived almost 500 years ago. Menno Simons was first a Catholic priest. As he read and studied the Bible, Menno began to understand the Christian life in a different way. Eventually he became an Anabaptist preacher. It was against the laws of that time for him to preach so Menno&#39;s preaching was done in secret at night to small groups. Soon, Menno Simons became the leader of the Anabaptists, now known as Mennonites. For 9-to-14-year-olds.</p><p>The story of all that happened as Menno went about preaching is seen through the eyes of Bettje and Jan. They too suffered hardships because their father was a night preacher. One Mennonite historian who read the story said that it was a &#34;&#34;lively, accurate, highly readable&#34;&#34; story of Menno Simons. The author was careful in adding details to see that they were in keeping with the way people lived and thought in those days.<b><p>Louise A. Vernon was born in Coquille, Oregon.

She live in Racine, Wisconsin.What if there were a grisly double murder in your family&#39;s past? What if that unsolved murder were a dark family secret uncovered by furtive sleuthing? Carol Jordan Stewart offers a fast-paced narration of 12-year-old Amy&#39;s story as she struggles with a concealed past and a terrifying present. Stewart&#39;s unimpassioned delivery of Amy&#39;s Aunt Claire is perfectly suited to the emotionally controlled woman who has hidden the pain of her parents&#39; murders for more than thirty years. And Stewart&#39;s superb reading of Amy&#39;s developmentally delayed sister, Luanne, employs the cadences and innocence befitting such a character.

Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.<br></i><br>Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use &#x201c;please&#x201d; and &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself. <br><br>But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and <i>be</i> just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music&#x2013;with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world&#x2013;shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a &#x201c;normal&#x201d;?<br><br>There are intense pressures coming from the world around him&#x2013;including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers.

Lou Arrendale, well compensated for his remarkable pattern-recognition skills, enjoys his job and expects never to lose it. But he has a new boss, a man who thinks Lou and the others in his building are a liability. Lou and his coworkers are autistic. And the new boss is going to fire Lou and all his coworkers--unless they agree to undergo an experimental new procedure to "cure" them.<p> In <i>The Speed of Dark</i>, Elizabeth Moon has created a powerful, complex, and believable portrayal of a man who varies radically from what is defined as "normal." The author insightfully explores the nature of "normality," identity, choice, responsibility, free will, illness and health, and good and evil. <i>The Speed of Dark</i> is a powerful, moving, illuminating novel in the tradition of <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>, <i>Forrest Gump</i>, and <i>Rain Man</i> . <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>&#x201c;<i>The Speed of Dark</i> gives a stunning, insightful and openhearted look at the world through the eyes of a man with autism.

Kennedy Assassination</h2><p>The assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas forty years ago remains, and will always remain, indelible in the minds of those old enough to recall it. The youngest elected leader in American history, a charming man leading what seemed a charmed life, by general consensus a president whose administration, having survived its early crises, was now at last hitting its stride, was shot and killed by a sniper firing a mail-order rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. So great was the shock that time seemed to freeze in the squinting glare of late-November sun. For four days in November 1963, the business of the nation ground to a halt. <br><br>The coverage provided by <i>The New York Times</i> is still generally considered the most complete of its day. Almost miraculously, <i>Times</i> reporters, writers, and editors produced 250 columns, or about 200,000 words, on and about the very first day. The other three days were no less exhaustive. Through the combined efforts of, among many others, Tom Wicker, James Reston, Max Frankel, Anthony Lewis, Harrison Salisbury, A. M. Rosenthal, and Arthur Gelb, <i>The Times</i> covered history as it was happening, from the assassination to the funeral. Here were the first portraits of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby, the earliest speculation regarding the prospects of Lyndon Johnson's administration, the immediate reaction from world leaders, and, perhaps most of all, the pulse of a populace reeling from an event that surpassed both understanding and belief.<br><br>This commemorative volume provides a haunting, firsthand, and detailed chronology of the events that took place in Dallas and Washington from November 22 to November 25, 1963. Here is history being recorded in the moment---a recitation not just of facts but of emotions and reactions as they were being experienced. The clarity of the writing is matched only by the almost desperate intensity of its occasion. Getting all the news that's fit to print seemed the only way of keeping the world from spinning further into chaos; <i>The Times</i>'s coverage provided not just information but a sense of balance. Though no one would ultimately explain to everyone's satisfaction the why, the who, what, and how were brought with amazing speed and accuracy within our grasp. <br><br>f0With an introduction by Tom Wicker and edited by Robert B. Semple Jr., <i>Four Days in November</i> is an extraordinary book. It will serve as an invaluable resource for anyone wanting to remember, to understand, and most of all to feel what it was like, minute by minute, detail by detail, while one of the most traumatic events in recent American history unfolded.<br></p><p>Tom Wicker, a former Op-Ed columnist for <i>The New York Times</i>, is the author of several books, including <i>Kennedy Without Tears</i>, <i> A Time to Die</i>---about the Attica, New York, prison uprising---and, most recently, a biography of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. <br><br>Robert B. Semple Jr., a Pulitzer Prize-winning member of <i>The Times</i>'s editorial board, worked in the Washington bureau of the paper in 1963.<br>On the 40th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination, the New York Times is republishing all of its coverage from November 22, the day Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy, to November 25, the day of the president's funeral. Readers who recall the assassination will find their memories jarred by long-forgotten details, such as the name of the Dallas police officer killed during the Oswald manhunt (it was Tippit). They will also be surprised by names of then unknown players that are now familiar (one is 29-year-old Bill Moyers, described as "[a]mong the closest and brightest of Mr. Johnson's intimates"), while the names of lions of the day, like Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn, may be barely recalled. Many will also be struck with how unpredictable was the future that in retrospect seems inevitable. In the moment, there is no hint that a snippet of film taken by "home movie enthusiast" Abraham Zapruder would become the driving force for a cult of conspiracy theorists. Likewise, newly sworn-in President Johnson's fateful commitment to winning the war in Vietnam is buried in a "background" article. This is not a book to be read cover to cover many articles are of little interest but there are some examples of terrific writing: Tom Wicker, James Reston and Anthony Lewis were all in their prime. Overall, the more than 600 pages of coverage engenders a deep appreciation of how profound was the country's anguish at the loss of its young president. 32 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>History of American Presidential Elections, 1789-2008, Fourth Edition, 3-Volume Set (Facts on File Library of American History)</h2><p>For more than 200 years, candidates have campaigned for the highest office in the land, debating the major issues facing the country, capturing the attention of the voters, and reflecting the will of the people.

Try <i>Pavo en K'ol Indio</i> (Turkey Simmered in <i>Masa</i>-Thickened Broth) with <i>Xni Pec</i> (Roasted Tomato and Chile Salsa). Aztecs prepared most food by steaming, stewing, or roasting. Two of the three come into play with <i>Lomo de Puerco en Cacahuete</i> (Pork Loin in Peanut and Red Chile Sauce). Incas had a wide variety of vegetables and grains in their diet. Quinoa, used in <i>Tamales de Quinoa</i> (Quinoa Tamales with Pork Filling) among other dishes, was considered a sacred food. <i>Spirit of the Earth</i> admirably commemorates these three cultures' contributions to modern cuisine. <i>--Dana Van Nest</i>BEVERLY COX learned to cook in Paris, where she apprenticed with world-renowned chef Gaston LeN�tre.

It gives an account of Woolf's early years and illuminates her relationship with her father, who played such a vital role in her development as a writer. </p><p>The other three pieces were composed to be read to the members of the Memoir Club, a group of Bloomsbury habitues whose trademark was absolute candor in their dealings with each other.</p></p><p>8 1.5-hour cassettesVIRGINIA WOOLF (1882&#x2013;1941) was&nbsp;one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century. An admired literary critic, she authored many essays, letters, journals, and short stories in addition to her groundbreaking novels.</p><h2>Prophecy: Child of Earth (Rhapsody, Book 2)</h2><p><p>In <i>Rhapsody</i>, a fellowship was forged-- three companions who, through great adversity, became a force to be reckoned with: Rhapsody the Singer; Achmed the assassin-king; and Grunthor, the giant Sergeant-Major. <i>Prophecy</i> continues their powerful epic. Driven by a prophetic vision, Rhapsody races to rescue a religious leader while Achmed and Grunthor seek the F'dor-- an ancient and powerful demon. These companions may be destined to fulfill The Prophecy of the Three, but their time is running short. They must find their elusive enemy before his darkness consumes them all.</p></p><p>Three cheers for Elizabeth Haydon! One great book (<i>Rhapsody: Child of Blood</i>) might be a fluke. But its sequel, <i>Prophecy: Child of Earth</i>, keeps right on developing great characters in a believable fantasy world without sacrificing the momentum of a terrific story. Best of all, Haydon promises to bring the current adventure to a conclusion in the next book, so no need to fear TNS (the never-ending saga).<p> <i>Prophecy</i> continues the stories of Rhapsody, the Namer who uses song, herb-lore, and affinities with fire and starlight to heal and protect, and her adoptive family: Achmed the Snake, an obnoxious former assassin and King of the savage Firbolg race, and Grunthor, his huge, cheerfully cannibalistic sidekick. Rhapsody travels in the company of the mysterious Ashe, who becomes much less mysterious as the story progresses. She meets a dragon, trains with a Lirin swordmistress who once carried Rhapsody's fiery sword, Daystar Clarion, and races to prevent the assassination of the Patriarch of Sepulvarta. Meanwhile, Achmed and Grunthor discover secrets of their mountain stronghold and learn more of their own powers. Together they repel renewed attacks by the F'dor, a demon seeking apocalyptic destruction. But they have not yet identified the demon's host or disarmed all of its agents, and time is running out.</p><p> Fans of epic fantasy will find Haydon a worthy successor to Tolkien, ranking with Robin Hobb and Guy Gavriel Kay. Just don't start reading too late in the day--once you've begun, you won't want to stop. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>As the daughter of an air force officer, <i>USA Today</i> bestselling epic fantasy author ELIZABETH HAYDON began traveling at an early age and has since traveled all over the world. She draws on the imagery of these visits in the Symphony of Ages series, and blends her love of music, anthropology, herbalism and folklore into much of her writing. Haydon is also a harpist and a madrigal singer (a singer of medieval songs). She lives with her family on the East Coast.</p><h2>The Loved One: An Anglo-American Tragedy</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

Daily served in the United States Navy for four years before attending Trenton Junior College. He continued his studies with a full Merit Scholarship to Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles and graduated in 1968 with a BFA in Illustration. Moving to Philadelphia, PA, he began his career as a freelance illustrator, represented by New York agents Frank and Jeff Lavaty. Over the next 24 years, he worked on national advertising, motion picture, and editorial accounts. Clients included: TWA, Equitoriana Airlines, Coleco Toys, U. S. Army National Guard, Weyerhauser Paper, Reader&#x2019;s Digest Condensed Books, Spider Magazine, Highlights Magazine, Cosmopolitan Magazine, TV Guide, and the Franklin Library. He created covers for Dell, Fawcett, and Doubleday Publishers, and posters for &#x201c;The Great Santini&#x201d;, &#x201c;California Suite&#x201d;, &#x201c;The Four Seasons&#x201d;, &#x201c;Roots&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Cheers&#x201d;. In addition to his illustration work, Don painted private oil portrait commissions and was a Certified Member of the American Portrait Society. He was also an honored member of The New York Society of Illustrators, where his work appeared annually in juried shows. From 1989-1991, Don was an Instructor of Illustration at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. In 1992, Don began working exclusively on children&#x2019;s books, completing nine books for Philadelphia publisher Running Press and one for Dial Books before his death. Sales of his books currently reach almost 2,000,000 copies, in eight languages. Don was a frequent guest speaker at book stores, libraries, and elementary schools. His book illustrations were in many regional group shows including Rosenfeld Gallery, Art in City Hall, Main Line Art Center, and Markham Art Center. He had one-man exhibits of his children&#x2019;s book paintings at the University of the Arts, Cabrini College, Main Line Art Center, and the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, NJ. Don&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s illustrations reflect his joy of life and passion for painting. A meticulous painter of detail and superb colorist, his work is infused with humor and humanity. Don spent about nine months on each book, from his initial conceptual sketches, through the design and layout phases, to the finished paintings in water color and gouache. His partnership with Running Press allowed him free-reign in all stages of the process. He researched costumes, locations, and the myriad of details necessary to create such convincing and charming illustrations. He used himself, his wife and two children, and his friends as models for his book characters, and transformed them as needed into witches, princesses, farmers, and even animals, through the magic of his active imagination and incredible drawing skills.

Out of the blue, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams of Guernsey - by chance, he&#39;s acquired a book that once belonged to her - and, spurred on by their mutual love of reading, they begin a correspondence. When Dawsey reveals that he is a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, her curiosity is piqued and it&#39;s not long before she begins to hear from other members. As letters fly back and forth with stories of life in Guernsey under the German Occupation, Juliet soon realizes that the society is every bit as extraordinary as its name.</p><p>MARY ANN SHAFFER was born in 1934 in Martinsburg, West Virginia. She worked as an editor, a librarian and in bookshops. She became interested in Guernsey while visiting London in 1976. On a whim, she decided to fly to Guernsey but became stranded there as a heavy fog descended and no boats or planes were permitted to leave the island. As she waited for the fog to clear, she came across a book called Jersey Under the Jack-Boot, and so her fascination with the Channel Isles began. Many years later, when goaded by her own literary club to write a book, Mary Ann naturally thought of Guernsey. Mary Ann died in February 2008. She knew that this, her only novel, was to be published in thirteen countries. Before she died she wrote, &#39;I must tender special thanks to my niece, Annie, who stepped in to finish this book after unexpected health issues interrupted my ability to work shortly after the manuscript was sold. Without blinking an eye, she put down the book she was writing, pushed up her sleeves, and set to work on my manuscript. It was my great good luck to have a writer like her in the family, and this book could not have been done without her.&#39; ANNIE BARROWS is the author of the Ivy and Bean series for children, as well as The Magic Half.<i>Part One<br></i><br><br>8th January, 1946<br>Mr. Sidney Stark, Publisher<br>Stephens &amp; Stark Ltd.<br>21 St. James's Place<br>London S.W.1<br>England<br><br>Dear Sidney,<br>Susan Scott is a wonder. We sold over forty copies of the book, which was very pleasant, but much more thrilling from my standpoint was the food. Susan managed to procure ration coupons for icing sugar and real eggs for the meringue. If all her literary luncheons are going to achieve these heights, I won't mind touring about the country. Do you suppose that a lavish bonus could spur her on to butter? Let's try it&#x2014;you may deduct the money from my royalties.<br><br>Now for my grim news. You asked me how work on my new book is progressing. Sidney, it isn't.<br><br>English Foibles seemed so promising at first. After all, one should be able to write reams about the Society to Protest the Glorification of the English Bunny. I unearthed a photograph of the Vermin Exterminators' Trade Union, marching down an Oxford street with placards screaming "Down with Beatrix Potter!" But what is there to write about after a caption? Nothing, that's what.<br><br>I no longer want to write this book&#x2014;my head and my heart just aren't in it. Dear as Izzy Bickerstaff is&#x2014;and was&#x2014;to me, I don't want to write anything else under that name. I don't want to be considered a light-hearted journalist anymore. I do acknowledge that making readers laugh&#x2014;or at least chuckle&#x2014;during the war was no mean feat, but I don't want to do it anymore. I can't seem to dredge up any sense of proportion or balance these days, and God knows one cannot write humor without them.<br>In the meantime, I am very happy Stephens &amp; Stark is making money on Izzy Bickerstaff Goes to War. It relieves my conscience over the debacle of my Anne Bront biography.<br><br>My thanks for everything and love,<br>Juliet<br><br>P.S. I am reading the collected correspondence of Mrs. Montagu. Do you know what that dismal woman wrote to Jane Carlyle? "My dear little Jane, everybody is born with a vocation, and yours is to write charming little notes." I hope Jane spat on her.<br>From Sidney to Juliet<br>10th January, 1946<br>Miss Juliet Ashton<br>23 Glebe Place<br>Chelsea<br>London S.W. 3<br><br>Dear Juliet:<br>Congratulations! Susan Scott said you took to the audience at the luncheon like a drunkard to rum&#x2014;and they to you&#x2014;so please stop worrying about your tour next week. I haven't a doubt of your success. Having witnessed your electrifying performance of "The Shepherd Boy Sings in the Valley of Humiliation" eighteen years ago, I know you will have every listener coiled around your little finger within moments. A hint: perhaps in this case, you should refrain from throwing the book at the audience when you finish. <br><br>Susan is looking forward to ushering you through bookshops from Bath to Yorkshire. And of course, Sophie is agitating for an extension of the tour into Scotland. I've told her in my most infuriating older-brother manner that It Remains To Be Seen. She misses you terribly, I know, but Stephens &amp; Stark must be impervious to such considerations.<br><br>I've just received Izzy's sales figures from London and the Home Counties&#x2014;they are excellent. Again, congratulations! <br><br>Don't fret about English Foibles; better that your enthusiasm died now than after six months spent writing about bunnies. The crass commercial possibilities of the idea were attractive, but I agree that the topic would soon grow horribly fey. Another subject&#x2014;one you'll like&#x2014;will occur to you.<br><br>Dinner one evening before you go? Say when.<br><br>Love,<br>Sidney<br><br>P.S. You write charming little notes.<br>From Juliet to Sidney<br>11th January, 1946<br><br>Dear Sidney,<br><br>Yes, lovely&#x2014;can it be somewhere on the river? I want oysters and champagne and roast beef, if obtainable; if not, a chicken will do. I am very happy that Izzy's sales are good. Are they good enough that I don't have to pack a bag and leave London?<br><br>Since you and S&amp;S have turned me into a moderately successful author, dinner must be my treat.<br><br>Love,<br>Juliet<br><br>P.S. I did not throw "The Shepherd Boy Sings in the Valley of Humiliation" at the audience. I threw it at the elocution mistress. I meant to cast it at her feet, but I missed.<br>From Juliet to Sophie Strachan<br>12th January, 1946<br>Mrs. Alexander Strachan<br>Feochan Farm<br>by Oban Argyll<br><br>Dear Sophie,<br>Of course I'd adore to see you, but I am a soul-less, will-less automaton. I have been ordered by Sidney to Bath, Colchester, Leeds, and several other garden spots I can't recall at the moment, and I can't just slither off to Scotland instead. Sidney's brow would lower&#x2014;his eyes would narrow&#x2014;he would stalk. You know how nerve-racking it is when Sidney stalks. <br><br>I wish I could sneak away to your farm and have you coddle me. You'd let me put my feet on the sofa, wouldn't you? And then you'd tuck blankets around me and bring me tea? Would Alexander mind a permanent resident on his sofa? You've told me he is a patient man, but perhaps he would find it annoying. <br><br>Why am I so melancholy? I should be delighted at the prospect of reading Izzy to an entranced audience. You know how I love talking about books, and you know how I adore receiving compliments. I should be thrilled. But the truth is that I'm gloomy&#x2014;gloomier than I ever was during the war. Everything is so broken, Sophie: the roads, the buildings, the people. Especially the people. <br><br>This is probably the aftereffect of a horrid dinner party I went to last night. The food was ghastly, but that was to be expected. It was the guests who unnerved me&#x2014;they were the most demoralizing collection of individuals I've ever encountered. The talk was of bombs and starvation. Do you remember Sarah Morecroft? She was there, all bones and gooseflesh and bloody lipstick. Didn't she use to be pretty? Wasn't she mad for that horse-riding fellow who went up to Cambridge? He was nowhere in evidence; she's married to a doctor with grey skin who clicks his tongue before he speaks. And he was a figure of wild romance compared to my dinner partner, who just happened to be a single man, presumably the last one on earth&#x2014;oh Lord, how miserably mean-spirited I sound!<br><br>I swear, Sophie, I think there's something wrong with me. Every man I meet is intolerable. Perhaps I should set my sights lower&#x2014;not so low as the grey doctor who clicks, but a bit lower. I can't even blame it on the war&#x2014;I was never very good at men, was I? <br><br>Do you suppose the St. Swithin's furnace-man was my one true love? Since I never spoke to him, it seems unlikely, but at least it was a passion unscathed by disappointment. And he had that beautiful black hair. After that, you remember, came the Year of Poets. Sidney's quite snarky about those poets, though I don't see why, since he introduced me to them. Then poor Adrian. Oh, there's no need to recite the dread rolls to you, but Sophie&#x2014;what is the matter with me? Am I too particular? I don't want to be married just to be married. I can't think of anything lonelier than spending the rest of my life with someone I can't talk to, or worse, someone I can't be silent with.<br><br>What a dreadful, complaining letter. You see? I've succeeded in making you feel relieved that I won't be stopping in Scotland. But then again, I may&#x2014;my fate rests with Sidney. <br><br>Kiss Dominic for me and tell him I saw a rat the size of a terrier the other day.<br><br>Love to Alexander and even more to you,<br>Juliet<br>From Dawsey Adams, Guernsey, Channel Islands, to Juliet<br>12th January, 1946<br>Miss Juliet Ashton<br>81 Oakley Street<br>Chelsea<br>London S.W. 3<br><br>Dear Miss Ashton,<br>My name is Dawsey Adams, and I live on my farm in St. Martin's Parish on Guernsey. I know of you because I have an old book that once belonged to you&#x2014;the Selected Essays of Elia, by an author whose name in real life was Charles Lamb. Your name and address were written inside the front cover.<br><br>I will speak plain&#x2014;I love Charles Lamb. My own book says Selected, so I wondered if that meant he had written other things to choose from? These are the pieces I want to read, and though the Germans are gone now, there aren't any bookshops left on Guernsey. <br><br>I want to ask a kindness of you. Could you send me the name and address of a bookshop in London? I would like to order more of Charles Lamb's writings by post. I would also like to ask if anyone has ever written his life story, and if they have, could a copy be found for me? For all his bright and turning mind, I think Mr. Lamb must have had a great sadness in his life.<br><br>Charles Lamb made me laugh during the German Occupation, especially when he wrote about the roast pig. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society came into being because of a roast pig we had to keep secret from the German soldiers, so I feel a kinship to Mr. Lamb.<br><br>I am sorry to bother you, but I would be sorrier still not to know about him, as his writings have made me his friend.<br><br>Hoping not to trouble you,<br>Dawsey Adams<br><br>P.S. My friend Mrs. Maugery bought a pamphlet that once belonged to you, too. It is called Was There a Burning Bush? A Defense of Moses and the Ten Commandments. She liked your margin note, "Word of God or crowd control???" Did you ever decide which?<br>From Juliet to Dawsey<br>15th January, 1946<br>Mr. Dawsey Adams<br>Les Vauxlarens<br>La Bouree<br>St. Martin's, Guernsey<br>Dear Mr. Adams,<br>I no longer live on Oakley Street, but I'm so glad that your letter found me and that my book found you. It was a sad wrench to part with the Selected Essays of Elia. I had two copies and a dire need of shelf-room, but I felt like a traitor selling it. You have soothed my conscience. <br><br>I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some secret sort of homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers. How delightful if that were true.<br><br>Because there is nothing I would rather do than rummage through bookshops, I went at once to Hastings &amp; Sons upon receiving your letter. I have gone to them for years, always finding the one book I wanted&#x2014;and then three more I hadn't known I wanted. I told Mr. Hastings you would like a good, clean copy (and not a rare edition) of More Essays of Elia. He will send it to you by separate post (invoice enclosed) and was delighted to know you are also a lover of Charles Lamb. He said the best biography of Lamb was by E. V. Lucas, and he would hunt out a copy for you, though it may take a while. <br><br>In the meantime, will you accept this small gift from me? It is his Selected Letters. I think it will tell you more about him than any biography ever could. E. V. Lucas sounds too stately to include my favorite passage from Lamb: "Buz, buz, buz, bum, bum, bum, wheeze, wheeze, wheeze, fen, fen, fen, tinky, tinky, tinky, cr'annch! I shall certainly come to be condemned at last. I have been drinking too much for two days running. I find my moral sense in the last stage of a consumption and my religion getting faint." You'll find that in the Letters (it's on page 244). They were the first Lamb I ever read, and I'm ashamed to say I only bought the book because I'd read elsewhere that a man named Lamb had visited his friend Leigh Hunt, in prison for libeling the Prince of Wales. <br><br>While there, Lamb helped Hunt paint the ceiling of his cell sky blue with white clouds. Next they painted a rose trellis up one wall. Then, I further discovered, Lamb offered money to help Hunt's family outside the prison&#x2014;though he himself was as poor as a man could be. Lamb also taught Hunt's youngest daughter to say the Lord's Prayer backward. You naturally want to learn everything you can about a man like that. <br><br>That's what I love about reading: one tiny thing will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you onto another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book. It's geometrically progressive&#x2014;all with no end in sight, and for no other reason than sheer enjoyment. <br><br>The red stain on the cover that looks like blood&#x2014;is blood. I got careless with my paper knife. The enclosed postcard is a reproduction of a painting of Lamb by his friend William Hazlitt. <br><br>If you have time to correspond with me, could you answer several questions? Three, in fact. Why did a roast pig dinner have to be kept a secret? How could a pig cause you to begin a literary society? And, most pressing of all, what is a potato peel pie&#x2014;and why is it included in your society's name?<br><br>I have sub-let a flat at 23 Glebe Place, Chelsea, London S.W.3. My Oakley Street flat was bombed in 1945 and I still miss it. Oakley Street was wonderful&#x2014;I could see the Thames out of three of my windows. I know that I am fortunate to have any place at all to live in London, but I much prefer whining to counting my blessings. I am glad you thought of me to do your Elia hunting.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Juliet Ashton<br><br>P.S. I never could make up my mind about Moses&#x2014;it still bothers me.<br>From Juliet to Sidney<br>18th January, 1946<br><br>Dear Sidney,<br>This isn't a letter: it's an apology. Please forgive my moaning about the teas and luncheons you set up for Izzy. Did I call you a tyrant? I take it all back&#x2014;I love Stephens &amp; Stark for sending me out of London. <br><br>Bath is a glorious town: lovely crescents of white, upstanding houses instead of London's black, gloomy buildings or&#x2014;worse still&#x2014;piles of rubble that were once buildings. It is bliss to breathe in clean, fresh air with no coal smoke and no dust. The weather is cold, but it isn't London's dank chill. Even the people on the street look different&#x2014;upstanding, like their houses, not grey and hunched like Londoners. <br><br>Susan said the guests at Abbot's book tea enjoyed themselves immensely&#x2014;and I know I did. I was able to un-stick my tongue from the roof of my mouth after the first two minutes and began to have quite a good time. <br><br>Susan and I are off tomorrow for bookshops in Colchester, Norwich, King's Lynn, Bradford, and Leeds.<br><br>Love and thanks,<br>Juliet<br>From Juliet to Sidney<br>21st January, 1946<br>Dear Sidney,<br><br>Night-time train travel is wonderful again! No standing in the corridors for hours, no being shunted off for a troop train to pass, and above all, no black-out curtains. All the windows we passed were lighted, and I could snoop once more. I missed it so terribly during the war. I felt as if we had all turned into moles scuttling along in our separate tunnels. I don't consider myself a real peeper&#x2014;they go in for bedrooms, but it's families in sitting rooms or kitchens that thrill me. I can imagine their entire lives from a glimpse of bookshelves, or desks, or lit candles, or bright sofa cushions.</p><h2>The Survival of the Wisest</h2><p>The Survival of the Wisest [Jan 01, 1973] Salk, Jonas</p><p></p><h2>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</h2><p>The title character of this darkly comic off-Broadway hit, the winner of two Obie Awards and an Outer Critics Circle Award, is transsexual singer Hedwig, and the Angry Inch refers both to her back-up rock band, and her botched sex change operation.

It explains how the State's bedrock was formed and how its landscape evolved. This publication is essentially a reprint of the 1st edition: modifications include several changes in geologic age dates and in stratagraphic tables. Major improvements are the addition of a subject index, a list of illustrations, and a list of tables. The State's bedrock geology and glacial features are discussed by region so readers can focus easily on the many examples of geologic phenomena in every part of the state. A detailed table of contents and summaries at the beginning of each chapter guide the reader to specific information. Chapters 1-3 provide a context for grasping the big picture. This section discusses the enormity of geologic time to help the reader appreciate how slowly many spectacular geologic events unfold. It explains continental drift with the plate techtonic theory. This theory describes the earth as a heat engine that operates with incomparable slowness. Continents drift about, oceans open and close, mountains build and erode...This theory provides a theme that connects and explains the major events of geologic history. Chapters 4-10 describe the bedrock of New York State by region. These chapters focus not only on what type of rock is present but also on how it came to be there. The seven regions covered are the Adirondack Mountains, Hudson Highlands and Manhatten Prong, Hudson-Mohawk Lowlands and Taconic Mountains, Northern Lowlands and Tug Hill Plateau, Erie Lowlands and Allegheny Plateau, Newark Lowlands, and Atlantic Coastal Plain. Much of the section on surface deposits (Chapters 11-14) is devoted to the Ice Age. Chapter 12 sums up the history of the Pleistocene Epoch in New York State. Chapter 13 lists glacial features found across the state today. Also included in the section are chapters on the Tertiary period (before the Ice Age) and the Holocene Epoch (after the Ice Age). Chapters 15-18 discuss how the geologic environment influences human activity. Topics covered are mineral resources, surface water, groundwater, earthquakes, and engineering geology. Technical terms are defined when they first appear in the text and are compiled in a glossary, as well. The glossary, which defines 800 words and phrases, is an invaluable tool for readers with little or no background in geology. An appendix contains drawings of common fossils, a physiographic map of the U.S., a map of New York's fault systems, a series of 61 block diagrams showing the plate tectonic evolution of eastern North America, and a list of statewide maps related to geology that are available from the New York State Museum. This publication includes a separate full color folded sheet (22 X 56 inches, printed on both sides) titled the "New York State Geologic Highway Map", as part of its illustrations. This sheet includes four parts: Plate 1, A View from Space: New York and Surrounding Areas; Plate 2, Geologic Map and Cross Sections (both Plates 1 &amp; 2 at 1:1,000,000 scale for easy comparison); Plate 3, Legend for the Geologic Map (layed out as a state-wide stratigraphic correlation chart); Plate 4 includes two New York regional maps, a physiographic map and a tectonic map and two index maps of New York, one of routes of geological field guides and one of points of geological interest. This Highway Map illustrates many of the concepts in the book.</p><p>This is one of the New York State Museum&#39;s most popular publications. It is the required textbook utilized by college and university professors across New York State for their introductory geology courses.Dr. Ed Landing has been New York State Paleontologist since 1986. He arrived at the NYS Museum in 1981 following receipt of a BS at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a master&#39;s and doctorate at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and post-doctoral appointments at the University of Waterloo (Ontario), US Geological Survey in Denver, and University of Toronto. His research has focused on the earlier invertebrate fossils of the eastern and western US, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Quebec, Maritime Canada and Newfoundland, southern Britain, Morocco, and the Middle East.</p><h2>The Bible Cure for High Blood Pressure: Ancient Truths, Natural Remedies and the Latest Findings for Your Health Today (Bible Cure Series)</h2><p><b>OVER 3 MILLION BIBLE CURE BOOKS SOLD<br> FROM THE<i> NEW YORK TIMES</i> BEST SELLING AUTHOR OF <i>THE SEVEN PILLARS OF HEALTH</i> AND<i> I CAN DO THIS DIET</i></b><br> You can lower your blood pressure and feel better-naturally!

Everyone calls it suicide. Josie knows it isn&#x2019;t . . . but fears it could be. After all, she had provided Gabe with a motive. The clues are so strong that even Josie begins to believe Gabe shot himself. But when a horrific slaying occurs literally at her feet, she knows Gabe was murdered, and her determination to prove it carries her toward dark corners of the beach strip and exposes the darker sides of its residents. Fending off her fears with humour and outrage, she encounters a drug-crazed drifter, an organized-crime boss with romance on his mind, a woman with a murderous past and a pervert who&#x2019;s been frequenting her garden shed. When a chance remark leads Josie to the astonishing truth of Gabe&#x2019;s death, her story takes a shocking turn that no one could have seen coming.</p></p><p><p>JOHN LAWRENCE REYNOLDS is the author of more than two dozen works of fiction and non-fiction.

What they share with her other fiction is Christie's gift for sharp observations about people, the ambitions that drive them, their relationships, and the conflicts that erupt between them. This omnibus edition brings together three of the Westmacott novels:<br><br><i>A Daughter's Daughter: </i> A daughter's opposition to her mother's plan to remarry threatens to destroy their relationship<br><br><i>Unfinished Portrait:</i> Bereft of three people she has held most dear, Cecilla must decide if she has the strength to come to terms with the past.<br><br><i>The Burden:</i> The burden of one sister's love for her younger sister--whom she's sworn to protect--has a drmatic effect on both their lives.<br></p><p>Agatha Christie is the best-selling author of all time. She wrote eighty crime novels and story collections, fourteen plays, and several other books. Her books have sold roughly four billion copies and have been translated into 45 languages. She is the creator of the two most enduring figures in crime literature&#x2014;Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple&#x2014;and author of <i>The Mousetrap</i>, the longest-running play in the history of modern theatre. Christie was born in Torquay, Devon in 1890. She died in 1976 in Wallingford, Oxfordshire."The Westmacott novels are extraordinary."--<i>The Telegraph</i></p><h2>The Yahweh Encounters: Bible Astronauts, Ark Radiations and Temple Electronics</h2><p>This astonishing analysis of the Bible reveals that the Scriptures are filled with technological data, and speak of a visitation to earth by celestial beings who created man. Strong evidence is presented that the Exodus tabernacle and the temple of Solomon, with the ark as centerpiece, were microwave transceivers comminicating with orbiting spaceships. &#34;The Yahweh Encounters&#34; also examines Biblical predictions of 21st century technology including orbiting thought -control devices and laser exterminators; a comparison of ancient and modern UFOs; and Biblical descriptions of the horrors of a one-world dictatorship and end-time cosmic disasters, to occur just before the return of Jesus and the spaceships. Three of the twelve chapters include circuit descriptions involving plasma physics, crystal lasers, ionic loudspeakers, sonic holography, microwave resonators, and twelve six-foot diameter metal dish antennas on wheels. The plan of the construction and operating procedures (rituals) were taken directly from the Bible passages of God&#39;s plans given to Moses and Solomon.</p><p>The author holds degrees from George Washington University and the University of North Carolina, and brings together her findings from twelve years of research into the Christian Bible, original meanings of Biblical terms, and data from non-canonized books and religious texts older than the Bible. Her chief advisor on the three technical chapters was her husband, who holds a mathematics degree with a minor in physics from the University of North Carolina and a Master&#39;s from the University of West Florida,and attended numerous military schools in electronics, including microwave systems.Quotes From Letters To The Author And Publisher: <p>"...I heard an interview with you on a radio station ... and later bought the book "The Yahweh Encounters".

At the novel&#39;s center: a uniquely fascinating woman, Triana--who once dreamed of becoming a great musician--and the demonic fiddler Stefan, tormented ghost of a Russian aristocrat, who begins to prey upon her, using his magic violin first to enchant, then to dominate and draw her into a state of madness through the music she loves. But Triana understands the power of the music perhaps even more than does Stefan--and she sets out to resist Stefan and to fight not only for her sanity but for her life. The struggle draws them both into a terrifying supernatural realm where they find themselves surrounded by memories, by horrors, and by overwhelming truths. Battling desperately, they are at last propelled towards the novel&#39;s astonishing and unforgettable climax. Violin is crowded with the history, the drama, the invention, and the romantic intensity that have become synonymous with Anne Rice at her incomparable best.</p><p>If neatness counts for you, don't count on Anne Rice's musical-ghost novel <i>Violin</i>. It is an eruption of the author's personal demons, as messy as the monster bursting from that poor fellow's chest in the movie <i>Alien</i>. Like Rice, the heroine Triana lives in New Orleans, mourns a dead young daughter and a drunken mother, and is subject to uncanny visions. A violin-virtuoso ghost named Stefan time-trips and globetrots with Triana, taunting her for her inability to play his Stradivarius--which echoes composer Salieri's jealousy in <i>Amadeus</i> and possibly Rice's jealousy of her successful poet husband Stan Rice in the years before her own florid, lurid writing made her famous. The storytelling here is too abstract, but the almost certainly autobiographical emotions could not be more visceral. At one point, the narrator exclaims, "Shame, blame, maim, pain, vain!" But Rice's dip in the acid bath of memory was not in vain--she packs the pain of a lifetime into 289 pages.In the grand manner of Interview with the Vampire, Anne Rice&#39;s new novel moves across time and the continents, from nineteenth-century Vienna to a St. Charles Greek Revival mansion in present-day New Orleans to dazzling capitals of the modern-day world, telling a story of two charismatic figures bound to each other by a passionate commitment to music as a means of rapture, seduction, and liberation.</p><h2>Wherever You Go, There You Are</h2><p>Mindfulness is considered the heart of Buddhist meditation. But its essence is universal and of deep practical benefit to everyone. Wherever You Go, There You Are, Jon Kabat-Zinn maps out a simple path for cultivating mindfulness in our lives, and awakening us to the unique beauty and possibilities of each present moment. He shows us how this simple meditation technique can enable us to be truly in touch with where we already are, so that we can be fully aware at all times. Jon Kabat-Zinn explains: What &#39;mindfulness&#39; is; How to achieve mindfulness using simple meditation techniques; How mindful meditation can enhance every aspect of your life; How to incorporate mindfulness into your everyday life</p><p>In his follow-up to <i>Full Catastrophe Living</i>--a book in which he presented basic meditation techniques as a way of reducing stress and healing from illness--here Jon Kabat-Zinn goes much more deeply into the practice of meditation for its own sake. To Kabat-Zinn, meditation is important because it brings about a state of "mindfulness," a condition of "being" rather than "doing" during which you pay attention to the moment rather than the past, the future, or the multitudinous distractions of modern life. In brief, rather poetic chapters, he describes different meditative practices and what they can do for the practitioner. The idea that meditation is "spiritual" is often confusing to people, Kabat-Zinn writes; he prefers to think of it as what you might call a workout for your consciousness. This book makes learning meditation remarkably easy (although <i>practicing</i> it is not). But it also makes it seem infinitely appealing. <i>--Ben Kallen</i>Jon Kabat-Zinn is the founder and former director of the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusettes Medical Centre. He lives in the Boston area.</p><h2>The 50 Greatest Love Letters of All Time</h2><p>If a picture speaks a thousand words, a love letter speaks a thousand more . . .<br><br>Even in this age of e-mail, faxes, and instant messaging, nothing has ever replaced the power of a love letter.

Said to be one of J.R.R. Tolkien's childhood favorites, <i>The Princess and the Goblin</i> is the story of the young Princess Irene, her good friend Curdie--a minor's son--and Irene's mysterious and beautiful great great grandmother, who lives in a secret room at the top of the castle stairs. Filled with images of dungeons and goblins, mysterious fires, burning roses, and a thread so fine as to be invisible and yet--like prayer--strong enough to lead the Princess back home to her grandmother's arms, this is a story of Curdie's slow realization that sometimes, as the princess tells him, "you must believe without seeing." Simple enough for reading aloud to a child (as I've done myself more than once with my daughter), it's rich enough to repay endless delighted readings for the adult. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>George MacDonald was a prolific writer who enjoyed enormous success with his books for both adults and children.

Expelled from Rugby for drunkenness, and none too welcome at home after seducing his father&#39;s mistress, the young Flashman embarks on a military career with Lord Cardigan&#39;s Hussars. En route to Afghanistan, our hero hones his skills as a soldier, duellist, imposter, coward and amorist (mastering all 97 ways of Hindu love-making during a brief sojourn in Calcutta), before being pressed into reluctant service as a secret agent. His Afghan adventures culminate in a starring role in that great historic disaster, the Retreat from Kabul.</p><p>The author of the famous Flashman Papers and the Private McAuslan stories, George MacDonald Fraser has worked on newspapers in Britain and Canada.

During the course of a long life, Sir Harry Paget Flashman (1822&#x2013;1915) served as a political adviser to Chancellor Bismarck on the Schleswig-Holstein question, briefly functioned as chief of staff to the Rajah of Sarawak, rode with both John Brown and Jeb Stuart, and even assisted the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico as an aide-decamp. Over the years this far-ranging traveler also spent some time as a buffalo hunter, western scout, Australian prospector, &#x2018;reluctant deputy marshal to J. B. Hickok, Esq.,&#x2019; and native interpreter &#x2013; Sir Harry spoke nine languages fluently and could &#x2018;rub along&#x2019; in another dozen or so.<br><br>Naturally, Who&#x2019;s Who &#x2013; with British discretion &#x2013; barely hints that Harry Flashman frequently spied for Her Majesty&#x2019;s government and that he was mixed up in both the African slave trade and the Underground Railroad. Moreover, through a run of astonishing bad luck, the man seems to have landed smack in the middle of virtually every major battle or civil insurrection of the nineteenth century &#x2013; the Siege of Gandamack in Afghanistan, the Zulu attack at Rorke&#x2019;s Drift, the rising of the Mahdi at Khartoum, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Peking Rebellion of 1900. During the American Civil War he even inexplicably managed to serve as a major in the Union forces and a colonel in the army of the Confederacy.<br><br>As it happens, when Mr Franklin met Sir Harry the then 92- year-old general had recently completed his personal memoirs, memoirs so disturbing that after his death they were quickly sealed and, it would appear, instantly forgotten. Indeed, the memory of Sir Harry himself gradually faded away, so that otherwise reliable histories of the Victorian era failed to assign him even a footnote. But, then, in 1965 during a sale of household furniture at Ashby in Leicestershire, the manuscript miraculously resurfaced. Ably edited by George MacDonald Fraser, the so-called Flashman Papers were eventually published in twelve volumes, each &#x2018;packet&#x2019; focusing on one or more episodes from their author&#x2019;s martial career. They begin with the teenaged Flashman&#x2019;s expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness &#x2013; an incident mentioned in Thomas Hughes&#x2019;s almost libelous Tom Brown&#x2019;s School Days &#x2013; and follow him up to the unpleasantness, very late in his life, with Colonel Sebastian &#x2018;Tiger Jack&#x2019; Moran. That last name may be familiar, as Moran was once described by the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes as &#x2018;the second most dangerous man in London&#x2019; and &#x2018;the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced&#x2019;.<br><br>But, really, what impropriety in these reminiscences could have offended the sensibilities of the Flashman family? The author was the most upright of eminent Victorians, the recipient of the San Serafino Order of Purity and Truth, the honorary president of the Mission for the Reclamation of Reduced Females, and the former governor of his alma mater, that bastion of muscular Christianity, Rugby School. Perhaps Sir Harry&#x2019;s family, in particular his clerical son, the Reverend<br>Bishop Harry Albert Victor Flashman, simply felt it wiser for posterity to honor a public career already well documented in Dawns and Departures of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life and &#x2019;Twixt Cossack and Cannon. Yet time has not been kind to these stiffly official memoirs. They are as forgotten now as if they had never existed, while great scholars and common readers alike return regularly to the Flashman Papers for instruction and delight. And, it goes without saying, for the irresistible brazen effrontery of the man himself. For in these memoirs, Sir Harry Flashman, the supposed Victorian equivalent of a &#x2018;parfit gentil knyght,&#x2019; reveals himself to be &#x2013; in his own words &#x2013; &#x2018;a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward &#x2013; and, oh yes, a toady.&#x2019;<br><br>In fact, Flashman is one of the world&#x2019;s most entertaining and beguiling rogues. He pursues life&#x2019;s pleasures with Casanovian gusto, regularly employs the colorful language of the barracks, and knows that &#x2018;there isn&#x2019;t any folly a man won&#x2019;t contemplate if there&#x2019;s money or a woman at stake.&#x2019; With his gallant sidewhiskers, bold dark eyes with hooded lids, and strong, aquiline nose, this charming dastard &#x2013; fourteen stone of sheer manliness &#x2013; regularly seduces schoolgirls and queens, hides or runs away when fights break out, and manages, through deception and utter poltroonery, to survive when better men die. As he says (in Royal Flash): &#x2018;The ideal time to be a hero is when the battle is over and the other fellows are dead, God rest &#x2019;em, and you take the credit.&#x2019;<br><br>The three startling, even shocking adventures reprinted in this Everyman omnibus provide the ideal introduction to Sir Harry&#x2019;s rumbustious life. In Flashman the youthful anti-hero spends his last day at Rugby, enlists in the army, captures the heart (and body) of the fair-haired Elspeth, and reluctantly embarks on a mission to mountainous, war-torn Afghanistan. In Flash for Freedom! the luckless Flashy joins the crew of an African slave ship, unwillingly assists the Underground Railroad, and fortuitously meets a rising young American politician named Abraham Lincoln. (In later years, Lincoln was known to say: &#x2018;When all other trusts fail, turn to Flashman.&#x2019; I believe that the word &#x2018;all&#x2019; should be emphasized.) Finally, Flashman in the Great Game takes our man into the world of Kim, as he spies for the British, dallies with a luscious maharani, and desperately struggles to survive the blood-baths of the Sepoy Mutiny.<br><br>That he does so will hardly come as a surprise, nor that he emerges from his Indian nightmare not only alive but also elevated to a knighthood. Nevertheless, a few crudely unimaginative critics have suggested that nobody could actually have escaped from so many deadly ambushes and battles. Two or three have even gone so far as to speculate that George Mac-DonaldFraser is&nbsp; the&nbsp; author, not the editor, of the Flashman Papers, with the deeply cynical implication that Flashman himself is merely a character in a series of clever novels. Sigh. What can you expect these days from cloistered academics, none of whom is even half as alive as Flashman? Flashy may not be as admirable as, say, Don Quixote, Lord Greystoke or Sherlock Holmes, but he&#x2019;s certainly just as real.</p><h2>Great Plains</h2><p>The author profiles the storied Great Plains of the American Midwest, relating the history, the lore, and the stories of the current inhabitants of the area</p><p><b>Ian Frazier</b> is the author of <i>Great Plains</i>, <i>The Fish's Eye</i>, <i>On the Rez</i>, <i>Family</i>, and <i>Travels in Siberia</i>, as well as <i>Dating Your Mom</i>, <i>Lamentations of the Father</i>, and <i>The Cursing Mommy's Book of Days</i>.

Neatly editing for a popular audience, Mowat amplifies the texts with minimal intrusion. In the earliest account here (1769-1772), Samuel Hearne describes an almost 5000-mile trek, and trains his eye on the Indians who accompany him--their cookery and customs, including a self-preservation tactic where a sick squaw is left behind to fend for herself, and their bloody ambush of the slumbering Eskimo foe. Later that century, Alexander Mackenzie fails to find a route to the Pacific Ocean but discovers the major river now bearing his name. During WW I, Mounties search the tundra, investigating the disappearance of two Belgian missionaries. In the 1920s, Edgar Christian, fresh from English public school, intends to spend a winter on the plains with his eccentric cousin, trapper John Hornby. Christian's journal relates desolation, cold and an excruciatingly slow death by starvation that claims the entire party.

On the day of Pascual's birth, angels sing in the trees, and his father realizes that "God must surely love him." Acrylic illustrations with soft pastel backgrounds show Pascual as a little boy, frolicking joyfully with animals and hanging garlands of flowers around the necks of sheep. The winsome paintings capture his serene spirituality as he and the creatures lift their voices toward heaven. Simple, well-chosen words reflect the youngster's sincere love for God and all of His creatures. When Pascual is older, he goes to the monastery of Saint Francis, hoping to become a friar and help the hungry. However, the friars ask him to make their meals. Knowing nothing about cooking, Pascual bows his head and prays. Suddenly, apron-wearing angelic visitors "swoosh in the air above him" and then descend to concoct a feast. Curious about the delicious meals coming from the kitchen, the friars spy on the dinner preparations and learn the truth. Realizing how much God values him, they decide to take a joyful Pascual with them to feed the hungry. Framed by light peach watercolors splashed with rainbow-colored droplets, the illustrations beautifully complement the celestial mood. An author's note provides some background about this humble man.--James K. Irwin, Poplar Creek Main Library, Steamwood, IL <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.*Starred Review* PreS-Gr. 2. In his continuing series of books that look at the lives of the saints, dePaola introduces one who is perhaps lesser known in the pantheon, but who makes a delightful subject, nonetheless. The angels sing from the trees when Pascual is born, and as a boy, Pascual communicates with the sheep he watches over. Pascual, known for his generosity, joins the Franciscan friars as a young man, but when he is assigned to kitchen work, he despairs; he can't cook a bean. Not to worry. The angels, who have observed him from birth, are happy to prepare meals while Pascual kneels in prayer. This story, with a tender, light feeling, is an ideal vehicle for dePaola's familiar images, here dappled with whimsy. Particularly charming are the pictures of the young Pascual so attuned to the animals that he sings with the sheep, each one of which wears a garland he has made. However, it is the young angels, flitting across the cover and the inside spreads, wrapped in aprons and busily gathering ingredients and cooking, that steal the show. A dear book, with an author's note that reveals more about the saint. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The most disturbing war stories are those that humanize the statistics to make us imagine what it would be like for people like us. This grim, immediate account of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima, translated from the Japanese, is told by a teacher who survived but who saw his child die in the explosion. He remembers how his son, Shin, longed for a tricycle; but Japan had declared war on America and other countries, and by 1945 there was no metal available for toys. Then,<i> </i>a few weeks before Shin's fourth birthday, his uncle managed to give him the tricycle he longed for. Shin was pedaling his beloved toy when the bomb dropped on the city. The facts are gruesome, and, although there's no exploitation, nothing is softened. Shin did not die immediately; he was one of the burning civilians, pleading for water; his father rushed the boy to the river, but the screaming people were dying when they drank the water. When Shin died, his parents buried him and his best friend with the tricycle. Recently, the tricycle was dug up, and it now stands in the Peace Museum in Hiroshima. The paintings are powerful, almost super-real at times, as the father remembers his child at play. There's one view from above the ordinary street and then, suddenly, a double-page spread of exploding light followed by nightmare scenes lit by flame. Like Toshi Maruki's <i>Hiroshima No Pika</i> (1982), this disturbing picture book is not for small children but for middle-graders to read with an adult and talk about. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Sauron Dominion (War World Vol. III)</h2><p>Intent on keeping the planet Haven cut off from the rest of the empire while they slowly absorb all normal humanity into their own perverted form, a race of hideous supermen escalate Haven&#39;s fierce wars</p><p></p><h2>Ichiro</h2><p><p>Ichiro lives in New York City with his Japanese mother.

Monroe&#x2019;s message proclaimed anticolonial principles, yet it rapidly became the myth and means for subsequent generations of politicians to pursue expansionist foreign policies. Time and again, debates on the key issues of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century foreign relations&#x2014;expansion in the 1840s, Civil War diplomacy, the imperialism of 1898, entrance into World War I, and the establishment of the League of Nations&#x2014;were framed in relation to the Monroe Doctrine. &nbsp;Covering more than a century of history, this engaging book explores the varying conceptions of the doctrine as its meaning evolved in relation to the needs of an expanding American empire. In Jay Sexton&#x2019;s adroit hands, the Monroe Doctrine provides a new lens from which to view the paradox at the center of American diplomatic history: the nation&#x2019;s interdependent traditions of anticolonialism and imperialism.</p><p>Jay Sexton is University Lecturer in American History, at Oxford University. He is the author of many works in the field of foreign relations, including <i>Debtor Diplomacy: Finance and American Foreign Relations in the Civil War Era 1837&#x2013;1873</i>.&nbsp; <i>1</i><i>Independence</i>The American Revolution was the first of what would be many struggles for independence from colonial rule in the Western Hemisphere. This &#x201c;age of revolutions,&#x201d; as it has been called, witnessed the gradual breakdown of the colonial empires that Old World powers had constructed in the preceding centuries. This process lasted throughout the nineteenth century (and, in some places, deep into the twentieth). It not only entailed the achievement of political independence from a colonial master, but also concerned the political arrangements that would replace centuries of colonial rule, which often were born out of the struggle for independence. In a broad sense, the dissolution of colonial rule in the Western Hemisphere also involved the much slower erosion of economic structures and cultural forms that had upheld colonial regimes, as well as their neocolonial successors. The multifaceted and protracted process of decolonization dominated the Western Hemisphere in the nineteenth century.1The origins of what later became the &#x201c;Monroe Doctrine&#x201d; lay not just in the deliberations of the Monroe cabinet in 1823, but in this larger geopolitical context. The message of 1823 was rooted in the policies and principles of statecraft that early American statesmen formulated to guide their young republic through the rocky waters of the dissolution of the European colonial order. These principles and policies looked both inward and outward. American statesmen aimed to bind together the various states, sections, and factions of their union that had been established during the era of the American Revolution. They also looked beyond their borders, seeking to consolidate their independence from an increasingly powerful British Empire, as well as to advance their interests in regions of the crumbling Spanish Empire. The interrelated processes that defined the Monroe Doctrine all shaped American statecraft long before 1823: the ongoing struggle of the United States against persistent British power, the nation-building process within the American union, and the projection of American power over peoples excluded from their constitutional arrangements.<i>The Rising British Empire</i>Early Americans were not bashful about proclaiming their ambitions for their fledgling republic. George Washington spoke of &#x201c;our rising empire&#x201d;; Thomas Jefferson boasted of the expanding American &#x201c;empire of liberty&#x201d;; and Tom Paine predicted that American principles &#x201c;will penetrate where an army of soldiers cannot; it will succeed where diplomatic management would fail ... it will march on the horizon of the world and it will conquer.&#x201d; In the twentieth century, American power would transform global politics, though perhaps not in the ways foreseen a century and more before. The global preeminence of the United States in our own time has given early American statesmen an aura of clairvoyance for predicting what one historian has called the &#x201c;rising American empire.&#x201d; Yet there was nothing preordained about the global rise of the United States. Though Americans predicted future greatness for themselves, they also were consumed with their vulnerabilities in an era in which their young and untested union faced challenges from within and without.2The empire that was most dramatically rising in the nineteenth century was not the American but the British. Despite having lost her most important North American colonies in the 1783 Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolution, the height of the British Empire lay in the future. The British Empire was larger and more powerful in 1820 than it had been in 1776. During the intervening decades, it tightened its grip on India; its resources and people poured into its settler colonies in Canada and Australasia; it acquired strategic way stations such as the African cape and Singapore; it increased its commercial and naval presence in distant markets in East Asia and in Latin America; its naval power became unrivaled; industrialization at home fueled economic growth and the expansion of overseas commerce; it developed a sophisticated and flexible financial system capable of both underwriting international trade and funding wars of unprecedented cost; and its political system weathered the ideological storm unleashed by the American and French revolutions. Even within North America, the British retained a position of great strength, holding Canada and the strategically important Caribbean islands of the British West Indies and maintaining relations with Native American tribes. Following the defeat of Napoleon&#x2019;s France after nearly a quarter of a century of conflict (1793&#x2013;1815), Britain stood atop the global hierarchy, a position of preeminence that it would consolidate as the nineteenth century progressed. By the early twentieth century, the British governed two-thirds of the world&#x2019;s colonial territories and three-quarters of its colonial population. To be sure, Britain&#x2019;s position of strength brought with it great anxiety stemming from the need to secure its many interests scattered around the globe, particularly as rivals emerged later in the century. This anxiety could serve as the rationale for retrenchment (as would be the case in North America) or could fuel further expansion (as would occur in Africa in the late nineteenth century).The nineteenth-century British Empire was a multifaceted and dynamic entity. It included formal colonial possessions such as India and, in the late nineteenth century, large portions of Africa, governed through governmental structures originating in London. Settler colonies in Canada and Australasia functioned as a virtual &#x201c;British West,&#x201d; as the historian James Belich has recently put it, attracting capital and migrants from the home country much like the American West of the same period. The inhabitants of the settler colonies enjoyed increased self-government during the nineteenth century, though they increasingly viewed themselves as members of a &#x201c;Greater Britain.&#x201d;3 In Latin America and East Asia, the British largely refrained from formal colonial rule, instead pursuing their interests through the informal projection of commercial and cultural power. Central to the British Empire in both its formal and informal manifestations were so-called collaborating elites, the native peoples whose self-interest led them to associate with the British. Recent historians have emphasized the interconnectivity and dynamism of the British Empire, arguing that its power rested on the fusion of its component parts. The integration of formal colonial possessions, settler colonies, and a global commercial empire constituted an expansive and adaptable &#x201c;British world-system,&#x201d; as it has recently been called.4 The decentralization of the British Empire contributed to its power and, as the nineteenth century progressed, paradoxically fueled its integration. Far from being the product of simple military might, the nineteenth-century British Empire rested upon the interconnected foundations of commercial and financial power, naval supremacy, communication networks, technological innovation, and political cooperation with indigenous elites.The expanding British Empire cast a long shadow over nineteenth-century America. The young United States remained entrapped in the webs of the British world-system long after achieving its political independence during the Revolution. &#x201c;In the year of grace 1776, we published to the world our Declaration of Independence. Six years later, England assented to the separation,&#x201d; wrote the American nationalist Henry Cabot Lodge in 1883. &#x201c;These are tolerably familiar facts,&#x201d; Lodge continued. &#x201c;That we have been striving ever since to make that independence real and complete, and that the work is not yet entirely finished, are not perhaps, equally obvious truisms.&#x201d; The persistence of &#x201c;colonialism in the United States,&#x201d; as Lodge called it, threatened to keep the United States in a position of subordination to its former colonial master.5The forms of British power in nineteenth-century America were as pervasive as they were enduring. When American statesmen consulted world maps, they found ever more territories colored red (the traditional color of British possessions); the national ledger books showed increasing indebtedness to British banks; English novels took up most of the space on American bookshelves; schoolchildren in the United States continued to be taught with British textbooks deep into the nineteenth century; popular songs&#x2014;even Francis Scott Key&#x2019;s &#x201c;Star-Spangled Banner,&#x201d; which later would become the national anthem&#x2014;were set to old British tunes. It would not be until 1828 that Noah Webster formalized the spellings of &#x201c;American English,&#x201d; and even then his dictionary served as much as a reminder of the links as of the differences between the two peoples. Nineteenth-century Americans were consumed by the question of how best to consolidate their independence from the British. The ongoing struggle to free themselves from the yoke of British imperialism united the disparate sections and peoples of the United States. It also created political divisions that endangered the union itself. British power was an inescapable reality that paradoxically threatened and benefited the young American republic.Nowhere did British power exert itself more in the United States than in the material world of economics. If anything, independence brought with it a closer economic relationship than had existed before 1776. British merchants and financiers quickly recovered their leading position in the American economy, elbowing aside their opportunistic Dutch and French rivals who had sought to replace them during the Revolution. For most of the nineteenth century, Britain would be the United States&#x2019; greatest source of foreign investment, its largest source of imports, and its most important foreign market. To be sure, this economic connection was symbiotic; just as Britain was central to the American economy, the United States was important to the British. But there is little doubt that the United States was the subordinate partner in the relationship. The young republic was a classic &#x201c;developing economy&#x201d; with vast resources at its disposal but lacking the means of exploiting them. The majority of American exports to Britain were raw materials and agricultural goods (especially, as the nineteenth century progressed, cotton), whereas most of Britain&#x2019;s exports to the United States were finished goods. Moreover, as Americans would discover in the run-up to the War of 1812, Britain&#x2019;s diplomatic and naval might could be turned against their republic, closing off the international connections upon which their economy relied.In the eyes of many Americans, this unequal economic arrangement threatened the very independence of the United States. As the Kentucky statesman Henry Clay put it in 1820, the United States was in danger of remaining a &#x201c;sort of independent colonies of England&#x2014;politically free, commercially slaves.&#x201d;6 The frequent financial panics that originated in London rippled through the American economy; banks in London had a habit of recalling loans when credit was tight in the United States; British manufacturers, exploiting the cheap labor at their disposal, undercut upstart American rivals; reliance on British capital necessitated unpopular compromises in foreign policy to reassure foreign bondholders. The American economy, in short, drifted in winds that originated across the Atlantic. As the Virginian John Taylor put it, &#x201c;The English who could not conquer us, may buy us.&#x201d;7Yet for all the potential dangers of economic dependence upon Britain, the United States greatly benefited from this relationship. The British market provided the chief outlet for America&#x2019;s farmers and cotton planters. If the period of international instability in the early nineteenth century demonstrated the dangers of reliance upon the British market, the ensuing century of Pax Britannica and unilateral British tariff reductions revealed the advantage. Even as the British lowered their tariffs, the United States remained free to protect its industries, an option it would take full advantage of later in the nineteenth century. British capital played an important role in the dramatic economic takeoff of the United States in the nineteenth century. Investment channeled to the United States by London banks, such as the powerful Baring Brothers firm, kept down interest rates in the capital-starved republic. British investment underwrote important aspects of the &#x201c;transportation revolution&#x201d; of canals and railroads, as well as financing the debts of municipalities, state governments, and the federal government itself. By the mid-nineteenth century, nearly half of the United States&#x2019; national debt was held abroad, chiefly in Britain. Funds provided to the federal government by Baring Brothers also underwrote American territorial expansion. Both the 1803 Louisiana Purchase (which acquired extensive territory in the interior of North America from France) and the Mexican indemnity payment of 1848 (which compensated Mexico for lands conquered by the United States) were made possible by loans from the English bank.These benefits notwithstanding, how to break the cycle of economic subordination to the British was a principal issue in early American politics. Though Americans in the early republic agreed that the status quo was undesirable, they disagreed over the means that would best establish their economic independence. From this debate emerged the political coalitions of the first party system of Republicans and Federalists. Led by Thomas Jefferson, Republicans sought to construct a liberal international order cleared of preferential trading systems. This commercial vision, which aimed to entrench republicanism at home and advance the interests of agricultural exporters, challenged the structures of the British Empire. When Britain would not acquiesce to American demands for open trade and the respect of neutral rights, Jeffersonian Republicans advocated economic retaliation (either in the form of tariffs, which Jefferson advocated as a temporary measure at various points in the 1790s, or, as in 1807&#x2013;1809, in the form of an all-out embargo). In opposition were the Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, who viewed Britain as an indispensable economic partner as well as a model to emulate. The Hamiltonian program called for the consolidation of the union&#x2019;s finances through the creation of a national bank and the federal assumption of state debts. The Federalists were prepared to make diplomatic compromises with their former colonial master to achieve their objectives, thus further widening the partisan divide at home. Most notable was the 1795 Jay Treaty, which averted war with Britain in the short term by addressing several leftover issues from the Revolutionary period, but outraged Republicans for aligning the United States with its old nemesis and for its failure to protect neutral rights on the high seas.If Republicans and Federalists disagreed on the means of establishing their independence, they were of one voice in identifying Britain as their greatest economic rival in the long term. For all their differences, both parties agreed on the fundamental objective of establishing American economic independence. Though the Federalists were pro-British elites, they differed from &#x201c;collaborating elites&#x201d; in Britain&#x2019;s empire by rejecting associations with the old country that infringed upon American sovereignty. Economic and political exigencies at times blurred the lines between the two parties. For all their heated rhetoric, when in power, both parties found it difficult to implement their policy visions.

Add exquisite sound effects and Woodward's lively reading, and the result is a big story in a small package. Often such sound effects can be distracting--this production is anything but.

The plan is to collapse the old shafts and refill the area with new soil, but the first explosions trigger unplanned subsidiary collapses. Ella Clah, attending the dedication and purification ceremony, acts quickly when she sees a young child sliding into the exposed tunnels. She saves his life but is herself trapped underground.<br><br>A few days later, Ella, little the worse for her nightmarish near-death experience, is checking out reports of vandalism and arson. It seems that gun control advocates on the Rez have made some enemies-enemies who soon kill for the first time, when an arson fire claims the life of the wife of a Navajo Councilmember. The home of local radio host George Branch--who may have incited the fatal arson-burns to the ground, destroying all of Branch's personal possessions, including his extensive gun collection. <br><br>Ella's investigations are hampered by what happened to her at the uranium site. Both her brother Clifford, a Navajo medicine man, and her cousin and fellow Navajo Police officer, Justine Goodluck, are convinced that Ella wasn't just unconscious when she was rescued. To all appearances, they say, Ella was dead. Justine believes that Ella's survival was a miracle; Clifford says that his <i>hataalii</i> abilities showed her wandering wind spirit the way back to her body. Regardless, traditionalist Navajo are reluctant to be near or even speak to Ella, fearing that since she was dead, she has been contaminated with chindi and become evil. Even some of her fellow police officers are uncomfortable in Ella's presence.<br><br>If she cannot interview witnesses and can't work with other cops, what is Ella to do? She finds solace in the unquestioning and unchanging love of her young daughter and the unflagging support of her brother, who nonetheless recommends an older hataalii who may be able to perform a special blessing ceremony for Ella. Still, it's clear that Ella's life has been changed, perhaps permanently, and that she may no longer be an effective police officer. <br></p><p>Aim�e and David Thurlo have been married for more than thirty years and have been writing novels together for nearly that long, in a variety of genres including romance, young adult, and mystery. They have three ongoing mystery series, the <i>Sister Agatha</i> series, starring a cloistered nun, the <i>Lee Nez</i> series, featuring a Navajo vampire who teams up with a female FBI agent to fight crimes that have elements of the supernatural, and their flagship series, the critically-acclaimed <i>Ella Clah</i> novels. Several Ella Clah novels, including T<i>racking Bear, Red Mesa,</i> and <i>Shooting Chant</i>, have received starred reviews from <i>Booklist</i>. <br><br>David Thurlo was raised on the Navajo Indian Reservation and later taught school in Shiprock, also on the Rez. Aim�e, a native of Havana, Cuba, has lived in New Mexico for more than thirty years. The Thurlos share their home with dogs, horses, and various pet rodents. They have written more than fifty novels which have been published in more than twenty countries.<br>ONE<br>&nbsp;<br>It was a cloudless spring morning, and even though a cool breeze was still flowing down from the nearby mountains, a crowd of nearly three hundred had assembled in the remote canyon south of Shiprock. This was a historic milestone for the <i>Dineh</i>, the Navajo People. Today, some of the uranium mines that lay like open wounds in the side of Mother Earth would finally be filled in.<br>Ella Clah, special investigator for the Navajo Tribal Police, proudly watched her mother, Rose, who was standing among the dignitaries behind the speaker's microphone. Rose had been integral to this effort, generating support for the work through her activism and leadership on tribal committees, and Ella had come to the ceremony today to support the tribe and honor what her mother had worked so hard to accomplish.<br>There was a saying among the Navajo that seemed to epitomize everything about Rose--"in-old-age-walking-the-trail-of-beauty." Today her mother was looking her best in a long blue velvet skirt and deep purple velveteen blouse fastened at her waist with a big silver concha belt. Around her neck, Rose wore the handcrafted silver and turquoise squash blossom that had been in their family for generations. Her long silver hair was tied neatly into a traditional bun fastened at the base of her neck.<br>Ella listened as the Christian minister, an Anglo named Campbell, said a brief prayer. Next, her brother Clifford, a respected <i>hataalii</i>, or medicine man, began singing <i>hatals</i>. These songs of blessing compelled the Navajo gods to bring good luck to the land the yellow dust had corrupted and give it new life.<br>Navajo prayers were not petitions. If recited just right, it was believed that the gods couldn't fail to comply. All Navajo knowledge was now being brought to bear on this problem that faced the <i>Dineh</i>. The People had even named the yellow dirt <i>Leetso</i> because using the name of their enemy would rob it of power and bring about its downfall.<br>Today was a special day for traditionalists and modernists alike. Everyone willing and hardy enough to make the long cross-country trip over the poorest of dirt roads was here to witness the historic occasion. The local television stations had sent crews to film the event, and some of the morning classes at the community college had been postponed so that the teaching staff could attend. She saw several of the Ship-rock college professors, including Wilson Joe and Preston Garnenez--who taught organic chemistry in the classroom that adjoined Wilson's. Both men were standing at the end of the row, beside the preacher.<br>This place was personal to Ella for completely different reasons. Near this spot she'd cornered and captured a cop killer just last year. And she recalled, with a chill running down her spine, she'd also discovered that skinwalkers--Navajo witches known for their evil practices and rituals associated with the dead--were using these old mines for their own purposes. Fortunately, skinwalkers had apparently stopped using this site after authorities had destroyed a few of the larger shafts.<br>Clifford had cleansed the area last year, and had done so again today before the crowd had gathered, but Ella still couldn't help but wonder where the skinwalkers had relocated to and when she'd cross paths with them again.<br>Hearing the enthusiastic countdown, she looked over to where the men in hard hats were standing. Then, as the first blast of explosives shook the earth, the crowd cheered.<br>So it began. As a demolition crew started the long process of sealing up the old, abandoned mines that had brought so much sickness and sorrow, Ella wondered if the new mining methods and safety procedures NEED was sanctioning would live up to expectations.<br>NEED, which stood for Navajo Electrical Energy Development, represented the Navajo Nation's first step toward a more prosperous future. Casinos on the large, isolated Navajo Nation would never be able to attract large numbers of patrons like the ones run by other tribes closer to population centers. The Navajo tribe's one small casino, being test-marketed at To'hajiilee, west of Albuquerque, had been doing well so far, but it hadn't gone into the black yet. Even if it was a big success, the facility wouldn't be able to make a substantial impact on the poverty that shadowed the Rez. Lack of funds still took a heavy toll on the tribe's ability to provide and maintain emergency services. Police equipment was badly outdated and salaries hadn't been improved in years. Even the hospital was understaffed these days and it was becoming nearly impossible to persuade many of the health professionals to remain there for long.<br>Ella was standing at the back of the gathering far from<br>the speaker, but she could hear her brother's voice clearly as it rose in a Song of blessing. When his voice softened slightly toward the middle of the Song, she became aware of the faint sound of children's laughter somewhere behind her. Recognizing the dangers inherent in that area because of all the uncovered and undocumented mine shafts, she wondered why anyone would bring kids here, even if it was Saturday.<br>Ella turned her head and caught a glimpse of one of the boys peeking around a washing machine-sized boulder. Julian, her brother's eight-year-old son, had recently told his father that he wanted to become a <i>hataalii</i> when he grew up. Like any proud papa, Clifford now allowed his son to accompany him as often as possible. But Ella was sure he'd counted on Loretta, his wife, to keep a better eye on him, particularly since they'd allowed Julian to bring his friend, Tim Manuelito.<br>Ella glanced around, trying to locate her sister-in-law, and finally saw Loretta helping a late-arriving Navajo woman to one of the few folding chairs provided for senior citizens. Ella recognized Susana Deerman. Her husband and son had died of Red Lung many years ago and Susana's granddaughter had not lived to see her first birthday. The child had been born with severe birth defects due to the contamination of the soil and drinking water around their home. The legacy of uranium mining had cast a long dark shadow over many families here in the Four Corners.<br>The words of her brother's chant, particularly poignant under the circumstances, touched her. "Beauty before me, beauty behind me, beauty above me, beauty below me. Beauty all around me," he intoned.<br>Feeling the heavy weight of sadness, Ella looked down at the barren soil. She wondered what possible good he could do here after all that had happened to this land.<br>Once again, Ella was distracted by the scuffling noises created by the two boys who were playing somewhere behind a cluster of boulders several yards away. Annoyed, she decided to haul them back to Loretta. It was dangerous to allow them to run around unsupervised, and Ella was certain Clifford didn't want his son to come across any skinwalker ritual items that might have remained in the area despite numerous searches.<br>Ella slipped quietly around the rock wall and managed to grab Tim Manuelito by the arm before he realized she was there. "This is an important ceremony, not recess," she said to the startled boy. "Go back to my sister-in-law and stay put."<br>"Yes, ma'am." Without looking back Tim hurried toward the group gathered around Clifford.<br>Julian stood up from atop his hiding place on a nearby boulder, climbed down, then came over to her. "I'll go back too, Aunt," he said, looking crestfallen.<br>"If you really want to become a <i>hataalii</i> someday you'll have to do a better job of listening and learning from your father."<br>"But the ceremony is <i>so</i> long."<br>"This is only a short blessing made up of prayers from the longer Sings. A full ceremony can take more than a week."<br>"Yeah, yeah, I know," he muttered softly. "But my friend lives way over by Hogback. He and I never get a chance to play together." He kept his gaze fastened on the ground, avoiding direct eye contact with her out of respect.<br>"I understand," she said, remembering how hard it had been for her to stay still at his age. "You just have to learn to be patient. Now come on. Let's go back. The land around here is sick, so you shouldn't be running around. You could fall into a hole or something."<br>As another underground blast shook the earth, Ella felt the earth shifting beneath her feet, like quicksand. She took a quick step to maintain her balance, but the ground between her and Julian suddenly collapsed. Julian yelled, then fell back, sinking into an ever-widening hole.<br>Ella dove forward onto the boards that had obviously been used to cover a mine shaft, grabbing the boy by the hand as he slid down. Sand was slipping out of sight like water down a drain. Ella held on to him, but she didn't have enough leverage to pull him back up. The rotten planks she was lying on were creaking and sagging as the support beneath them fell away.<br>Julian dangled helplessly over the edge, staring at her with terrified eyes. "I'm going to fall!"<br>"No. I won't let go."<br>Ella yelled for help, but as the ground rocked from another blast of explosives, her words were lost in the cheerful shouts of the crowd. Afraid the ground would shift again, she tightened her hold to a death grip, then inched closer to the edge of the shaft. Using every bit of strength she possessed, she slowly raised Julian up. "Grab my other hand and hang on tightly as I pull."<br>Seconds felt like eternities, but finally she managed to lift him to the edge of the boards and onto the surface where she was lying facedown. Julian was crying and Ella pulled him into her arms.<br>"I thought...I thought..." he managed, never quite finishing.<br>Ella hugged him tightly. "I know. But you're safe now. Crawl off these boards and get back over to solid ground. Then call your father to come and get you."<br>Ella watched Julian scramble clumsily out of the sandy depression they were in. Worried about the stability of the ground beneath her, she remained still until he'd cleared the area, then started to gently ease off the old wooden cover. The splintering boards were the only thing between her and an open pit that might continue down a hundred feet or more.<br>As she reached the edge and moved onto what she hoped was solid ground, the bottom suddenly fell out from beneath her. A wall of sand came sliding down and before she could cry out, Ella felt herself plummeting down a narrow tunnel.<br>Ella clawed wildly for a handhold, but nothing was there except cool sand and the darkness that engulfed her. Then she hit solid ground, the impact knocking the wind out of her. For several seconds she simply struggled to take a breath. She couldn't even scream for help until her lungs recovered.<br>Although Ella had no way of gauging how far she'd fallen, she was alive and that was all that really mattered to her at the moment. The soft sand beneath her had cushioned her fall and kept her from breaking any bones, as far as she could tell. She blinked several times, trying to get her eyes to adjust to the darkness, but opened or closed, all she could see was an inky blackness.<br>Gathering her courage, Ella stood up slowly. She was either at the bottom of the shaft or on a wide ledge. It was cold here, wherever that was. Ella reached out gingerly and felt the sandstone sides of the shaft. The walls were vertical and cut too smoothly to offer any handholds, though she searched by touch as high as she could reach.<br>Then she reached down, feeling along the ground, hoping to find a boulder or piece of wood she could use to dig with. Her hand touched something soft, and she flinched, thinking it might be a spider. Reaching down again, she realized it was a big feather. Picking it up, she noticed how heavy it felt. Attached to the bottom of the feather were two pieces of string, and at the end of each string was a round, rough-feeling bead.<br>That's when she remembered the skinwalker den she'd discovered last year. This belonged to one of them. Holding the feather away from her she tossed it aside, wanting to put as much distance as possible between her and the witch item.<br>Hoping that her nephew had seen her fall, Ella began to yell for help and continued for a long time, but no one came. Soon her throat stung and her voice began giving out. It was difficult to breathe down here and she couldn't help but wonder if she was actually drawing toxic air into her lungs every time she took a breath.<br>Panic knifed at her gut. Even if Julian hadn't seen her fall, she was certain that he'd soon notice her absence. Clinging to that, she took her pistol out of the holster, where it had somehow remained during all her tumbling and began to tap on the sides of the shaft, hoping the noise would carry to the surface. Then she tried to scrape out handholds. But every time she created a small shelf by digging out the sand, it would crumble away the minute she put any weight on it.<br>Ella yelled for help again, tapping the butt of her pistol against the sides of the tunnel at the same time. She'd always assumed she'd make it to old age, providing she managed to avoid getting killed on duty. Never once did she think she'd die alone, like this, with her death serving no purpose. It wouldn't even merit a heroic tale her daughter could take comfort and pride in.<br>Anger filled her. She wasn't ready to go. There was too much she'd left undone. She'd wanted to see her daughter grow up into adulthood. She'd wanted to be there for Dawn's <i>Kinaald�</i>, her womanhood ceremony, and take part as their family sang the first prayer.<br>She wouldn't die here. Not like this, not now. Determination gave her strength. Ella began to yell again, tapping the sides of the shaft and ignoring the raw pain at the back of her throat. Long after her voice had faded from the exertion, she kept tapping on the wall with her pistol.<br>Then, surprisingly, she heard an answering sound. Someone was tapping above her. Just to make sure, she tapped twice, then waited. Two taps from up above sounded in reply. Ella cheered, though her voice was scarcely more than a whisper now. But her victory was short-lived. In the time it took to go from one breath to the next, there was a resounding crash and a wall of sand came tumbling down on her. Ella hugged the side of the shaft, covered her head, and tried to make an air pocket as tons of sand closed in around her.<br>It was a fight she couldn't win. Sand reached her nose, then her mouth. She couldn't scream, she couldn't move. Then something hard slammed against her head and there was nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2004 by Aim�e and David Thurlo</p><h2>Flower Fairies of the Winter</h2><p>A deluxe addition to the Flower Fairies classics, complete with all of Cicely Mary Barker?s original poems and illustrations.

No matter how hard she&#x2019;s tried to be nice, Cain rudely rebuffs her at every turn, preferring to keep to himself. But when Julia catches Cain stealing her newspaper from the lobby of their apartment building, that&#x2019;s the last straw. She&#x2019;s going to break through Cain&#x2019;s Scrooge-like exterior the only way she knows how: by killing him with kindness.<br> &nbsp;<br> To track her progress, Julia starts a blog called The Twelve Days of Christmas. Her first attempts to humanize Cain are far from successful. Julia brings him homemade Christmas treats and the disagreeable grinch won&#x2019;t even accept them. Meanwhile, Julie&#x2019;s blog becomes an online sensation, as an astonishing number of people start following her adventures. Julia continues to find ways to express kindness and, little by little, chips away at Cain&#x2019;s gruff fa�ade to reveal the caring man underneath. Unbelievably, Julia feels herself falling for Cain&#x2014;and she suspects that he may be falling for her as well. But as the popularity of her blog continues to grow, Julia must decide if telling Cain the truth about having chronicled their relationship to the rest of the world is worth risking their chance at love.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Twelve Days of Christmas</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Another heartwarming seasonal [Debbie] Macomber tale, which fans will find as bright and cozy as a blazing fire on Christmas Eve.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Twelve Days of Christmas</i> is a delightful, charming read for anyone looking for an enjoyable Christmas novel. . . .

He inwardly groaned when he saw the woman who lived across the hall come racing toward him. He kept his eyes trained straight ahead, not inviting conversation. He&#x2019;d run into this particular woman several times in the last few months since he&#x2019;d moved into the building. She&#x2019;d stopped several times to pet Schroeder, his Irish setter. The one he&#x2019;d inherited from his grandfather when Bernie had moved into the assisted-living complex. She&#x2019;d chattered away, lavishing affection on the dog. Not the talkative type, Cain responded minimally to her questions. He liked her all right, but she was a bit much, over the top with that cutesy smile. Okay, he&#x2019;d admit it. He found her attractive. He wasn&#x2019;t sure what it was about her, because usually the chirpy, happy ones didn&#x2019;t appeal to him. Regardless, nothing would come of it and that suited him. He knew better. Yet every time he saw her a yellow light started flashing in his head. Warning, warning. Danger ahead. Cain could feel this woman was trouble the first moment he saw her and heard her exuberant &#x201c;good morning.&#x201d; Even her name was cheerful: Julia. Looking at her, it was easy to envision the opening scene from The Sound of Music, with Julie Andrews twirling around, arms extended, singing, joyful, excited. Even the thought was enough to make Cain cringe. He could do happy, just not first thing in the morning.<br><br>To put it simply, he found little good about mornings, and second, he&#x2019;d learned a long time ago not to trust women, especially the types who were enthusiastic and friendly. Experience had taught him well, and having been burned once, he wasn&#x2019;t eager to repeat the experience.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; she said a bit breathlessly as she floated into the elevator. Yes, floated. Her coat swirled around her as she came to stand beside him. On her coat&#x2019;s lapel she wore a pretty Christmas tree pin that sparkled with jewel-tone stones. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m running late this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>Pushing the button to close the door, Cain ignored her. He didn&#x2019;t mean to be rude, but he wasn&#x2019;t up for conversation.<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t I see you walking Schroeder in the dog park the other day?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t seen her. Maybe he had, but he wasn&#x2019;t willing to admit it.<br><br>&#x201c;Really? I&#x2019;m pretty sure I saw you.&#x201d;<br><br>He let her comment fall into empty space. Could this elevator move any slower?<br><br>Fortunately, the elevator arrived at the foyer before she could continue the conversation.<br><br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t much of a morning person, are you?&#x201d; she asked as he collected his newspaper, tucked it under his arm, and headed for the door.<br><br>Julia reached for her own and followed him. Would he never shake this woman? They were welcomed by the Seattle drizzle that was part of the winter norm for the Pacific Northwest. Cain&#x2019;s office at the insurance company where he worked as an actuary was within easy walking distance. Julia matched her steps with his until she reached the bus stop outside the Starbucks, where, thankfully, she stopped.<br><br>&#x201c;Have a good day,&#x201d; she called after him.<br><br>Cain would, especially now that he was free of Ms. Sunshine.<br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; Julia Padden stood in the foyer of her apartment building the following morning, astonished that her neighbor would steal her newspaper while she stood directly in front of him. She braced her fist against her hip and raised both her finely shaped eyebrows at him.<br><br>Showing his displeasure, Cain Maddox turned to face her, newspaper in hand. He had to be the most unpleasant human being she&#x2019;d ever met. She&#x2019;d tried the friendly route and got the message. Even his dog had better manners than he did.<br><br>&#x201c;I believe that newspaper is mine.&#x201d; Her apartment number had been clearly written with a bold Sharpie over the plastic wrapper. This was no innocent mistake. For whatever reason, Cain had taken a disliking to her. Well, fine, she could deal with that, but she wasn&#x2019;t about to let him walk all over her and she wasn&#x2019;t going to stand idly by and let him steal from her, either.<br><br>At the sound of her voice, Cain looked up.<br><br>Irritated and more than a little annoyed, Julia thrust out her hand, palm up. &#x201c;My newspaper, please.&#x201d;<br><br>To her astonishment, he hesitated. Oh puleese!! She&#x2019;d caught him red-handed in the act and he had the nerve to look irritated at her. How typical. Not only was he reluctant to return it, but he didn&#x2019;t have the common decency to look the least bit guilty. She&#x2019;d say one thing about him . . . the man had nerve.<br><br>&#x201c;Someone took mine,&#x201d; he explained, as if that gave him the right to steal hers. &#x201c;Take someone else&#x2019;s. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if it&#x2019;s technically yours or not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It most certainly does; it matters to me.&#x201d; To prove her point, she jerked her hand at him a second time. &#x201c;I am not taking someone else&#x2019;s newspaper and you most certainly aren&#x2019;t taking mine; now give it to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, fine.&#x201d; He slapped the newspaper into her open palm, then reached over and snagged some other unsuspecting apartment owner&#x2019;s.<br><br>Julia&#x2019;s jaw sagged open. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you did that.&#x201d;<br><br>He rolled his eyes, tucked the newspaper under his arm, and headed toward the revolving door, briefcase in hand.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t the first time her morning paper had mysteriously disappeared, either, and now she knew who was responsible. Not only was Cain Maddox unfriendly, he was a thief. Briefly she wondered what else he might be responsible for taking. And this close to Christmas, too, the season of goodwill and charity. Of course theft was wrong at any time of the year, but resorting to it during the holidays made it downright immoral. Apparently, her grumpy neighbor hadn&#x2019;t taken the spirit of Christmas to heart.<br><br>That shouldn&#x2019;t surprise her.<br><br>Cain and Julia often left for work close to the same time in the morning. Three times this week they&#x2019;d inadvertently met at the elevator. Being a morning person and naturally cheerful, Julia always greeted him with a sunny smile and a warm &#x201c;good morning.&#x201d; The most response she&#x2019;d gotten out of him was a terse nod. Mostly he ignored her, as if he hadn&#x2019;t heard her speak.<br><br>Julia waited until she was on the bus before she called her best friend, Cammie Nightingale, who now lived outside of Denver. They&#x2019;d attended college together. Cammie had graduated ahead of her when Julia&#x2019;s finances had dried up and she&#x2019;d been forced to take night classes and work full-time. After seeing so many of her friends struggling to pay off student loans, Julia had opted to avoid the financial struggles. Yes, it took her longer to get her degree in communications, and no, she hadn&#x2019;t found the job of her dreams, but she was close, so close. Furthermore, she was debt-free. Currently she worked at Macy&#x2019;s department store, where she&#x2019;d been employed for the last seven years.<br><br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe what happened this morning,&#x201d; she said as soon as Cammie picked up. Her friend was married and had a two-year-old and a newborn.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on a minute,&#x201d; Cammie said.<br><br>In her irritation, Julia hadn&#x2019;t asked if Cammie could talk. She waited a couple minutes before her friend picked up again.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My disagreeable neighbor, the one I told you about, is a thief. He tried to steal my newspaper.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I caught him red-handed, and when I confronted him and demanded he give it back he took someone else&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What? You&#x2019;re kidding me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No joke. Not only that, he was rude again.&#x201d; Come to think of it, he&#x2019;d never been anything but unfriendly. It was men like him who put a damper on Christmas. Julia refused to let him or anyone else spoil her holidays.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you talking about the guy who lives across the hall from you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The very one.&#x201d; The more Julia thought about what he&#x2019;d done, the more upset she got. Okay, so he wasn&#x2019;t a morning person. She could deal with that. But to steal her newspaper? That was low.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you know about him?&#x201d; Cammie asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing . . . well, other than he has a gorgeous Irish setter that he walks every morning.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d tried being neighborly, but Cain had let it be known he wasn&#x2019;t interested. She&#x2019;d started more than one conversation only to be subtly and not so subtly informed he took exception to small talk. After several such attempts, she got the message.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s shy.&#x201d;<br><br>Cammie possessed a generous spirit, but this time she was wrong. Anyone who&#x2019;d take her newspaper without a shred of guilt wasn&#x2019;t shy. &#x201c;I doubt it. Trust me on this. Cain Maddox isn&#x2019;t shy, and furthermore, he&#x2019;s not to be trusted.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong. I have this gift, a sixth sense about men. This one is sinister.&#x201d;<br><br>Cammie&#x2019;s laughter filled the phone. &#x201c;Sinister? Come on, Julia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; she insisted. &#x201c;Just what kind of man steals a newspaper? I don&#x2019;t know what I ever did to offend him, but he&#x2019;s made it more than clear he would rather kiss a snake than have anything to do with me.&#x201d; That bothered Julia more than she was comfortable admitting. He was kinda cute, too, in a stiff sort of way. He was tall, a good six or seven inches above her own five-foot-five frame.<br><br>His hair was dark and cut in a way that said he was a professional. The shape of his jaw indicated he had a stubborn bent, but that could be conjecture on her part, based on what she knew about him. And as best she could tell, he didn&#x2019;t possess a single laugh line, although he did have beautiful, clear dark chocolate eyes.<br><br>The only time she&#x2019;d seen him in anything but a suit was when he was at the dog park. He wore a jacket with the name of an insurance company and logo, which she assumed he was connected to in some way, and jeans. Even then he didn&#x2019;t look relaxed, and he held himself away from others.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you attracted to him?&#x201d; Cammie asked.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me. No way!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have a feeling this is why you&#x2019;re thirty-one and not in a serious relationship. How long are you going to hold on to Dylan, Julia?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That again?&#x201d; Julia didn&#x2019;t have time for relationships and she for sure wasn&#x2019;t going to drag Dylan into the conversation. She was over him and had been for a long time. The problem was she had no time to date, between working and volunteering at church and for the Boys and Girls Club. Cammie knew that.<br><br>Besides, she had more important matters on her mind.<br><br>The blog. The challenge.<br><br>She&#x2019;d gone through two intense interviews at Harvestware, a major software company, and the list had been narrowed down to two people. Because the job was in social media, the company had suggested a competition between the two candidates in the form of a blog. The one who could generate the largest following in the month of December would be awarded the job.<br><br>Julia had gladly accepted the challenge. Unfortunately, she hadn&#x2019;t had a lot of success so far; her following was minimal at best. This was her chance to prove herself.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe your neighbor is the man of your dreams.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cain Maddox? He&#x2019;s cold, Cammie. You haven&#x2019;t seen him. I have. Trust me&#x2014;he&#x2019;s not the kind of man you&#x2019;d want to meet in a dark alley.&#x201d;<br><br>The more Julia thought about it, the more convinced she became that her neighbor was some disreputable character. A chill went down her spine just thinking about the cold look in his eyes.<br><br>Cammie laughed out loud. &#x201c;Your creative imagination is getting away from you, my friend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe, but I doubt it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Julia,&#x201d; her friend said in that calm way of hers that suggested Julia was overreacting. &#x201c;He took your newspaper; he didn&#x2019;t threaten to bury you in concrete.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the look in his eyes, like he sees straight through people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve noticed his eyes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, they&#x2019;re brown and dark. Real dark and distant.&#x201d; Okay, Cammie was probably right. To see him in criminal terms was a bit of a stretch, but Julia wasn&#x2019;t exactly having warm, cozy feelings toward her neighbor.<br><br>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s the case, then I think you should kill him,&#x201d; Cammie suggested.<br><br>Julia gasped. She couldn&#x2019;t believe her bestie would even hint at such a thing.<br><br>&#x201c;Kill him with kindness,&#x201d; Cammie elaborated.<br><br>&#x201c;This guy needs a whole lot more than kindness.&#x201d; Leave it to her tenderhearted friend to suggest something sweet and good.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s twelve days until Christmas,&#x201d; she added after a moment, sounding excited.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. So?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is it, Julia. You&#x2019;ve been wanting an idea that would generate interest in your blog. Your neighbor is the perfect subject.&#x201d; Cammie seemed to be growing more enthused by the second. &#x201c;Weren&#x2019;t you saying just the other day how you were desperate for an over-the-top idea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, yes, but . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is perfect,&#x201d; Cammie continued. &#x201c;Kill him with kindness on your blog and report your progress for the next twelve days.&#x201d;<br><br>Julia wasn&#x2019;t keen on this. The less exposure to Cain Maddox she had, the better. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The countdown is sure to attract attention to your blog. All you need to do is to be kind to him. You&#x2019;re naturally friendly and funny. This guy won&#x2019;t know what hit him. And then you can document what happens on your blog. Mark my words, readers will love this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you even hear what I said?&#x201d; Julia reminded her friend. &#x201c;I can tell you right now kindness isn&#x2019;t going to affect him one way or the other.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t know until you try.&#x201d;<br><br>Julia bit down on her lower lip as visions of winning that highly paid position swirled in her head. Maybe Cammie was right. Maybe this idea would be just what she needed to generate a following that would show off her communication and writing skills.<br><br>&#x201c;I think people are responding to my blog about Christmas decorations.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Julia, do you have any idea how many people blog about making homemade tree ornaments? You&#x2019;re no Martha Stewart. You need something fresh and fun. A subject that will pique interest, something different&#x2014;and frankly, wreathmaking isn&#x2019;t it.&#x201d;<br><br>Surely there was a better way to tackle this challenge. Showing kindness to someone she disliked wouldn&#x2019;t be easy. In addition, she sincerely doubted it would make any difference. The man was annoying, disagreeable, and stubborn.<br><br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t saying anything,&#x201d; Cammie said, interrupting her thoughts. &#x201c;Which, from experience, I know is a good sign. You&#x2019;re actually considering doing this, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>Bouncing her index finger against her mouth, Julia said, &#x201c;I suppose killing him with kindness is worth a try.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It totally is.

Her grandfather was born in Ireland in 1869, in a place much like Knockabeg.A vivid portrait of an African-American artist whose work remains controversial but who demonstrated courage and perseverance in the face of enormous obstacles. Minnie Evans was born in 1892 in North Carolina to a poor family. As a child she was haunted by strange and powerful dreams often based on her strong religious faith. She left school after fifth grade, married Julius Evans at age 15, and had three sons. Still she dreamed, for the next 20 years, until she finally began to draw what she saw in her dreams. Her output steadily grew until she was producing half a dozen or more pictures a day, with no training and only the guidance of ``the angel that stands beside me.'' Interest in the self-taught artist began to spread until her work came to the attention of a photographer/folk art specialist, who took on the job of selling the paintings for much more than the 50 cents Evans was charging. Some fame followed before Minnie Evans died in 1987, having completed the task which she believed God had set before her. Lyons (Letters From a Slave Girl, 1992, etc.) uses Minnie's own words for the few chapters that chart her life, all illustrated with full-color reproductions of the artwork.

In 1914, at the age of thirty, Kent decides to escape the superficial world of New York City and move to Brigus, Newfoundland, with his wife and three children to follow a few months later. A socialist and a philanderer, certain in the greatness of his work, he is drawn north by a fascination for the rocky Atlantic coast and by the example of Brigus's other well-known resident, fabled Arctic explorer Robert Bartlett. But once in Newfoundland, Kent discovers that notoriety is even easier to achieve in a small town than in New York. As events come to a head both internationally and domestically and the war begins, Kent becomes a polarizing figure in this intimate, impoverished community, where everyone knows everyone and any outsider is suspect, possibly even a German spy. Writing in Kent's voice, Michael Winter delivers a passionate, witty, and cerebral exploration of what makes exceptional individuals who they are&#x2015;and why. </p><p><b>Shortlisted for the Trillium Award</b></p></p><p><p><b>Michael Winter</b> grew up in Newfoundland, Canada, and now lives in the relative warmth of Toronto.

The novel is a page-turner, not because of its plot, but because of its clarity and richness of its voice.&#x201d; <i>Quill &amp; Quire</i><br><br>Winter's spartan novel re-creates an episode in the life of the American artist Rockwell Kent, who, in 1914, left New York City for Brigus, Newfoundland, a bleak hamlet populated by fishermen, seal hunters, and an Arctic explorer. Kent, known in Manhattan as much for his temper and his philandering as for his woodcuts, wanted to lie low, and spent the winter hunkered down in a pup tent on the second floor of a freezing borrowed house. Before long, Kent began to attract suspicion as a possible German spy. (Among other things, he professed a love of German music and wrote "Bomb Shop" in Gothic letters on his studio door.) The next year, he was deported. Winter, who grew up in Newfoundland, creates a frugal voice for Kent's conversations with himself ornery, reflective, intimate, lewd and in doing so constructs an indelible portrait of the artist as outsider. .&#x201d; <i>The New Yorker</i></p><h2>Complete Peanuts 1967 1968</h2><p>It was gently gnawed on by the dog.

Jewish Immigrant Associations, by Daniel Soyer, holds an in-depth discussion on the importance of these hometown societies that provided members with valuable material benefits and served as arenas for formal and informal social interaction. In addition to discussing both continuity and transformation as features of the immigrant experience, this approach recognizes that ethnic identity is a socially constructed and malleable phenomenon. Soyer explores this process of construction by raising more specific questions about what immigrants themselves have meant by Americanization and how their hometown associations played an important part in the process.</p><p>An award-winning study of a vital immigrant institution and the formation of American ethnic identity.Daniel Soyer is a professor in the Department of History at Fordham University and a former archivist at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.</p><h2>Design for Dying</h2><p>As the fringe guru himself put it, "Mademoiselle Cancer moved in to share [his] body." But in the days before he died, Leary -- never one to miss an opportunity for a party -- used his approaching death to create an exuberant new vision of what dying can be. Optimism, courage, joy and spirituality were central to Leary's final days and his death. <em>Design for Dying</em> -- Leary's last book -- shows us how we too can make dying the high point of life. <p> Irreverent, thought-provoking and hilarious, Leary's parting shot pioneers new ways to die and new ways for the living to think about death. Urging us to take control of our deaths (and even to determine when and how we will die), Leary relates his own plan for "directed dying," a death we plan and orchestrate to reflect our own lives and values. </p><p> And the psychedelic prophet flings open a whole new range of beyond-death possibilites for the wired generation. From downloading consciousness onto the Net -- so that our souls can outlive our bodies -- to the way technology can enhance the final days of the dying to the far-out promises of cryogenics, Leary provides fascinating insights into how technology may eventually help us improve, and even sidestep, death. A thorough guide to death and dying resources and to online tools and further reading lists completes this surprising, funny and totally original look at the new frontiers of death. </p><p> Speaking to everyone who has ever wondered if there's more to death - -if there's life beyond the final frontier, if death really means the end, if dirges and hearses and funeral flowers are really how we want to be remembered -- Leary's flamboyant final statement rteveals revolutionary ways to die and redefines, with Leary's trademark creativity and joy, how the living can think about death.</p></p><p>Timothy Leary, high priest of psychedelia and former Harvard psychologist, spent decades enthusiastically investigating the meaning of life with the boundary-breaking, consciousness-expanding assistance of hallucinogenic drugs. It seems only natural that when "Mademoiselle Cancer moved in to share [his] body," he seized the opportunity to examine the nature of death ... and throw a big party. He didn't, as threatened, commit suicide on the Net or have his head cut off and frozen, but instead surrounded himself with good friends at an extended wake in his Beverly Hills home, where he drifted peacefully away. <p> In <i>Design for Dying</i>, his newly released book, Leary shows people how to die happily and well. "There are common-sense, easy-to-understand options for dealing planfully, playfully, compassionately, and elegantly with the inevitable final scene," he states. "Face it. At this point in human history, we're all terminal. It behooves us to focus some time and energy and courage on regaining personal and group autonomy over the dying process.... Talking about death is the last taboo in our society. And as we've learned, the way to overcome taboo is pretty straightforward. As the man says, 'Just Do It!'" The book includes contributions from R. U. Sirius of cyberculture magazine <i>Mondo 2000</i>; a guide to death and dying resources, online tools, and further reading lists; and an addendum of "Timothy Leary's Dying Performance as Remembered by His Friends." Timothy Leary vowed to "give death a better name or die trying," and <i>Design for Dying</i> attempts to do just that. Irreverent, original, and funny as ever, Timothy Leary urges us to face death with courage and joy, if not with laughing gas and a lava lamp.</p>Emerging a year after Leary's death compelled him to take his own famous advice and drop out for good, his last testament is rather a chore to plow through but does afford its rewards. (Sirius adds the occasional remark on the text and appends the best reading in the book: his own and others' responses to two questions about Leary's demise, which Leary once planned to transmit as it happened on his Web home page--so turn on and tune in, kids!--but finally didn't.) After plodding on in his own version of computer-nerdese on the meaning of life, "cybernautics," and language, Leary brightens when he turns to just what you would expect him to liven up about--drugs. He maintains interest while touting his contributions to his original profession, psychology, but waxes soporific again when expounding his theory of drug-assisted human mutation into a better species. The succeeding chapters about dying include giddily attractive advice ("Dying? Throw a House Party!" says one chapter title), speculation about finding immortality via computer information storage and cryogenics, and constant analogizing and reference to various drug highs. One thing is perfectly and charmingly clear: Tim Leary was an antiauthoritarian trickster--for him, the worst of all wars was the war on drugs--bone-deep and to the end. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>A Morning Cup of Yoga: One 15-minute Routine for a Lifetime of Health &amp; Wellness (Book and CD)</h2><p>Whether you&#39;re a novice or expert yoga practitioner, this accessible little book offers up 23 morning stretches to improve your health and well-being in just 14 minutes a day.

Kathy Kemp, columnist --The Birmingham News</p><h2>Every Day by the Sun: A Memoir of the Faulkners of Mississippi</h2><p>In <i>Every Day by the Sun, </i>Dean Faulkner Wells recounts the story of the Faulkners of Mississippi, whose legacy includes pioneers, noble and ignoble war veterans, three never-convicted mur�derers, the builder of the first railroad in north Mississippi, the founding president of a bank, an FBI agent, four pilots (all brothers), and a Nobel Prize winner, arguably the most important Ameri�can novelist of the twentieth century. She also reveals wonderfully entertaining and intimate stories and anecdotes about her family&#x2014;in particular her uncle William, or &#x201c;Pappy,&#x201d; with whom she shared color�ful, sometimes utterly frank, sometimes whimsical, conversations and experiences. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This deeply felt memoir explores the close re�lationship between Dean&#x2019;s uncle and her father, Dean Swift Faulkner, a barnstormer killed at age twenty-eight during an air show four months be�fore she was born. It was William who gave his youngest brother an airplane, and after Dean&#x2019;s tragic death, William helped to raise his niece. He paid for her education, gave her away when she was married, and maintained a unique relationship with her throughout his life. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the 1920s to the early civil rights era, from Faulkner&#x2019;s winning of the Nobel Prize in Literature to his death in 1962, <i>Every Day by the Sun </i>explores the changing culture and society of Oxford, Mis�sissippi, while offering a rare glimpse of a notori�ously private family and an indelible portrait of a national treasure.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>DEAN FAULKNER WELLS </b>is the niece of William Faulkner and the daughter of Dean Swift Faulkner and Louise Hale.

Murray's first appointment was to a remote and unattractive territory of nearly 50,000 square miles and 12,000 people. <p>In 1873, he helped to establish the Huguenot Seminary for girls. He also served as the first president of the Young Men's Christian Fellowship (YMCA). </p><p>Not only was Andrew Murray the author of over 240 books, he was also a man of great prayer. He began writing on the "deeper Christian life" - a favorite subject for Murray - for his congregation as an extension of his local pastoral work, but he became internationally known for his books, such as "With Christ in the School of Prayer"and "Abide in Christ", that searched men's hearts and brought them into a deep relationship with Christ. Writing with an intensity of purpose and zeal for the message of the Gospel, Murray wrote numerous books even after his retirement at age seventy-eight. .- Publisher.</p></p><h2>Love From Dr. Seuss</h2><p>&#34;The perfect collection of lines about love, from the one and only Dr. Seuss!

To do it four times is incredible. To do it four times in five years and always on a Friday the 13th is the stuff of legend. Welcome to the world of Steven Russell. Con artist. Thief. Swindler. Embezzler. Hopeless romantic.<p>A husband and father, Russell was a church organist, prosperous businessman, and onetime Boca Raton cop before turning to his life of crime. Arrested for a string of felonies, with a specialty in fraud, his real expertise turned out to be his uncanny ability to escape from jail. Between 1993 and 1998, he orchestrated a string of prison breaks that were as audacious as they were ingenious. Using whatever unlikely materials were at handa Magic Marker, a pay phone, a walkie-talkie, a pair of stolen bright red women's stretch pantsalong with an innate talent for analytical thinking and boundless quantities of sheer nerve, Russell again and again arranged his own "early releases" from jail. Unfortunately, for Russell, staying out of jail is another matter entirely.</p><p>Over the years, it became increasingly clear that Russell's talent for escape is matched only by his knack for getting arrested. One thing always seems to trump Steven Russell's careful planning, cool head, and instinct for self-preservationlove. Russell cannot resist the urge to try and spring the great love of his lifea fellow inmate named Phillip Morris.</p><p>In I Love You Phillip Morris, journalist Steve McVicker goes right to the heart of this improbable-but-true story of crime, punishment, and passion. Thanks to unprecedented and exclusive access to Russell, his family, and his friends, he retraces Russell's journey from small-town businessman to flamboyant white-collar criminal and jailhouse Houdini. It's the darkly comic tale of a man with a spectacular ability to manipulate almost everyone he meets, yet who is himself helpless in the face of love.</p></p><p>Steve McVicker is an award-winning journalist who has worked for the Houston Chronicle, National Public Radio, The New York Times, the Houston Press, and People. He lives in Texas. I Love You Phillip Morris is his first book.Steven Russell, the subject of this true crime story, is a rare individual, a genius who has run afoul of the law, a prodigious intellect endowed with boundless energy, audacity and guile. Russell pulled off his first jailbreak while waving a stolen walkie-talkie at a guard as he sauntered out the front gate, and his last escape-a feat of staggering self-discipline-by faking a terminal case of AIDS over several months and forging his own death certificate. Russell also walked out of prison and into a six-figure job as a CFO of a major company-twice. (The title of the book refers to Russell's only proven weakness-his steadfast love for one-time fellow convict Phillip Morris.) Journalist McVicker has written an unexceptional book about this exceptional man, but Russell's charisma-shining through lackluster prose-is what makes this offbeat biography a success. Like any great con man, Russell has a charm that is both disarming and overpowering, but his criminal antics are more effective and make for more interesting reading because they are coupled with unlikely virtues: sincerity, diligence, fidelity, affability. What McVicker does well is capture the accident of Russell's descent into criminality, a series of events that turned a once law-abiding husband, father and former police officer into one of the most innovative criminal minds in recent memory. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cogs, Caravels and Galleons: The Sailing Ship 1000-1650</h2><p>COGS, CARAVELS AND GALLEONS traces the development of seagoing vessels from the traditions of late antiquity to the all-important emergence of the three-masted ship, undoubtedly the most significant innovation in the history of shipping before the steam engine. Without the three-masted ship the European age of exploration and expansion is almost inconceivable and there is no doubt that the subsequent evolution of the world would have been markedly different.<br> In recent years much original research has been done in this field, based on both documentary sources and archeology, but this is the first overall synthesis of the new material now available. The main chapters are devoted to the principal ship types, explaining the latest thinking on the characteristics of cogs, caravels, and hulks that have caused scholarly debate for decades.<br> There are also more general sections on essential background subjects like construction and guns and gunnery, as well as pertinent essays on the evidence -- from documentary sources, contemporary illustrations and archeology. All the contributors are foremost experts in their fields, but in presenting the fruits of their research at an approachable level, COGS, CARAVELS AND GALLEONS is a pioneering work in this area of maritime history.<br> Lavishly illustrated, this informative volume - the eighth in an ambitious series - includes over 50 black-and-white photos, 145 illustrations, and five tables.</p><p>CONWAY'S HISTORY OF THE SHIP <p> The ship is probably the most influential tool in human history and it continues to exert a widespread and persistent fascination. CONWAY'S HISTORY OF THE SHIP is the first comprehensive and authoritative account of this technological and cultural phenomenon. <br> An unprecedented line-up of over one hundred leading maritime historians and specialists from around the world has been assembled to ensure that the work is informative, authoritative and fully international in outlook. <br> Every significant ship type from the dawn of seafaring to the present day is analyzed and detailed in coherent essays. Each volume adopts a strong theme which allows it to stand alone, but throughout the series a strict chronological sequence has been maintained.</p></p><h2>A Forest of Quilts: Designs for Those Who Love the Outdoors</h2><p>Quilters have searched high and low for realistic wildlife and nature designs.

His business books include <i>The Dilbert Principle</i> and <i>Dogbert�&#x2019;s Top Secret Management Handbook</i>, both #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. Adams has published twenty-three books with more than ten million copies in print.Adams builds his latest book (after 2004's <i>The Religion War</i>) out of entries from his blog, which results in a lot of short chapters and abrupt changes in topic. Still, some ongoing themes do emerge, as the bestselling cartoonist discusses his wedding plans&#x2014;including his fear that he'll dance like a drunken monkey at the reception&#x2014;and his struggle with spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological condition which took away his voice during intimate conversations even though he could still give speeches to large audiences. He even tosses in a few Dilbert strips, with several examples of gags that were suppressed by his syndicate (he couldn't show a police officer firing a gun, for example, but a doughnut that shoots bullets met with approval). Readers who only know Adams through the comics page will discover a saltier tone to his cynicism. If you have the choice of working as the guy who craps on the carpet, or the guy who has to clean it up, runs one bit of advice, only one of those jobs lets you read a magazine at the same time. The randomness of this collection may not attract many new fans, but it's likely to keep his already sizable audience amused. <i>(Oct. 18)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The 20 selections were culled from 6 books published between 1929 and 1967. Each chapter stands on its own, making this a good choice for reading aloud. However, keep in mind that these simple stories were written in a different time and place. For example, in one chapter, Milly-Molly-Mandy and her friend, Billy Blunt, do good deeds to counter a gang of mischievous boys in the town. The misdeeds of the latter include knocking hats off the heads of passersby and leaving gates open. Eventually, they come around and join up with Milly and Billy's group. Although some readers might consider the stories too bland and mundane, Brisley's characters are consistent and likable. Endpapers have a map of Milly-Molly-Mandy's village. Each chapter has one full-page and several smaller black-and-white drawings, reproduced from the originals.

Hardin (who wrote the foreword to this work), transcended mere history - both entered the realm of myth. Indeed, the siege and battle of the Alamo serves today as a definition of American character. The date of March 6, 1836, is forever ensconced in the annals of history. But what happened in the twelve days leading up to the final battle of March 6? And did events transpire in the final battle as history has led us to believe? Author Alan Huffines has researched both the history and the myth of the Alamo. What he found lacking in Alamo accounts was a perspective unaffected by either history or myth. In this book he portrays the events preliminary to and during the battle from the viewpoint of the participants. In a day-by-day chronology of the thirteen days, he presents original Texian and Mexican perspectives so that the reader may decide which may be accurate and which possibly embellished. His critical analysis of the participants&#39; reports, through extensive annotation, points out inconsistencies and provides considerable food for thought. The renowned military artist Gary S. Zaboly fastidiously researched primary sources for accuracy in clothing, weapons, architecture, geography, and so on, resulting in maps and artwork that offer a new visual perspective of the Alamo and those who were involved with the siege. Through the author&#39;s research and the artist&#39;s fine illustrations, the thirteen days come into focus, and the people who experienced the sights, smells, sounds, and emotions of that two-week period are allowed to speak finally for themselves.</p><p>Alan C.

Finally, scrambling up the last twenty feet, I stepped out on that ledge and looked. What I saw took my breath away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There it lay, stretched out against the horizon as far as I could see&#x2014;the thing I&#x2019;d been warned about, the thing I&#x2019;d been told was ultimately unavoidable. The sight of it was even more devastating than I&#x2019;d feared.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I was, hoping to travel to the distant shining city, a world of wonders I absolutely <i>had</i> to reach. For my first thirty years, I&#x2019;d never dreamed such a place even existed. Then when I started to believe it might, I tried like the devil to avoid thinking about it, for reasons I still don&#x2019;t understand. And now here I stood, all hopes of reaching that magical place dashed. Before me lay the biggest obstacle imaginable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was absolutely <i>un</i>imaginable. That great yawning chasm took my breath away. An abyss of staggering proportions. I had once stood with my family, when I had one, gazing down into the Grand Canyon. I&#x2019;d been swept away by its grandeur for a few minutes before needing to pack up the kids, grab a hamburger, and get them to the hotel. But this endless rift, this hole in the universe, made the Grand Canyon appear in comparison as the grave I dug when ten years old, to bury my old dog Ranger. It seemed infinitely large, deep and foreboding, containing not a shred of beauty. It stripped my heart of hope. For clearly the Chasm meant that the city calling to me from the great beyond, if it were real at all, lay forever out of reach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that mattered for me was the place I could still glimpse on the horizon, far beyond the impassible barrier spread out below me. <i>I had to get there</i>&#x2014;I had to reach that stunning capital of a great undiscovered country, that shining city that rested on the great white mountain. The place named <i>Charis</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Nick Seagrave. My story is true, though what world it happened in is hard for me to say. The memories burn in my brain, more real and weighty than what we call the real world. Before I tell you the incredible events that unfolded next, what happened to me at that chasm, I must first take you back to explain what led up to the moments I have just described. Only then can you understand me and my story, and perhaps unfold its meaning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember like it was yesterday that moment when I caught my first glimpse of Charis, glimmering in the distance. Initially I thought the remote city seemed cold, even oppressive. Our band of travelers that day had rounded a bend shaded by rock towers, and there it was, off to the west, rising high on a ridge. Silently, we all stared at it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From where we stood, all we could see between us and the mountain crowned by Charis were rolling green hills scrawled with various pathways, including a ribbon of red. This was the &#x201c;red road&#x201d; I&#x2019;d first learned of in some ancient inscriptions in a cave I&#x2019;d entered one evening to escape a pounding rain and crashing thunderstorm&#x2014;and something far worse. But that&#x2019;s another story, to tell another time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my traveling companions and I continued absorbing our first glimpse of the faraway city on the summit, it took only a moment for my heightened vision to pierce its walls. How did this happen? I can&#x2019;t explain it, but I was as certain of my perception as I could be. My intuition told me that the light was but a ruse, that inside the city all was dank and shadowy. And enthroned there sat a dreadful, intolerant tyrant, squashing creativity and initiative, enslaving any subjects foolish enough to have entered the city. I envisioned him granting his slaves freedom enough to make a mistake just so he could condemn them for it and command their execution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;d long ago learned to trust my instincts, which had helped make me such a successful businessman and entrepreneur. And those prized instincts assured me this city was a monument to the pride of some self-proclaimed, glory-hungry sovereign who delighted in robbing men of their dignity. A strangely confident assessment for one who knew so little. But if I lacked something in those days, it was not confidence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this insight percolated within me, our silence was broken by one of my companions&#x2014;a white-haired, craggy-faced man they called Shadrach, dressed in a tattered toga. &#x201c;Behold,&#x201d; he said, air moving through a gap in his teeth, &#x201c;Charis, the City of Light.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light? What about the shadows I felt certain lie within? How could that old geezer be fool enough to trust that light on the outside meant light within?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly another traveler, a young African woman named Malaiki, her face glowing, gasped, &#x201c;Do you hear it? <i>Music!</i>&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard nothing. Who was she trying to trick, and why?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With enchanting fervor Malaiki exclaimed, &#x201c;Songs of life and learning, choruses of pleasure and adventure! In a thousand languages!&#x201d; She broke into dancing, soon joined by some of the others.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were they trying to make fools of themselves? The uncomfortable thought struck me that perhaps I envied them, wishing I had a reason to dance. I quickly pushed the thought away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as they twirled and high-stepped, they kept looking toward the city. Following their gaze, I found my perception changing, despite my resistance. The coldness of the place was gradually replaced by light and warmth and by what seemed to be the radiant energy of people there celebrating. The city began to shimmer on the horizon, touched by sparkling blues and greens and golds that blended with the sky and sunlight, pulsing in and out of my vision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon I, too, could hear music from the city and then what sounded like a geyser of laughter exploding from a fountain of joy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My traveling comrades went on to speak of Charis as the city of a certain king whom they described in fantastic language. But my ingrained skepticism welled up and overtook me again. How could they make such claims? For reasons I couldn&#x2019;t grasp, I refused to let myself fall in with these people or be drawn to this city that enchanted them. I could not surrender control of my life&#x2019;s journey or its destination. I was master of my fate and captain of my soul. Besides, I reminded myself, I knew of someone who could take me elsewhere, to a better place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;d met Joshua on the morning I stumbled out of that cave, when I&#x2019;d wandered in a daze, not knowing where I really was. I started running, and as I came into an oak grove, a man bounded in my direction. He was tall, muscular, and handsome, with a neatly trimmed copper beard. He wore sandals and an emerald toga, cinched at his slender waist with a braided red cord. Though his dress was like a statesman&#x2019;s from another era, he somehow appeared modern and fashionable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Welcome, Nick,&#x201d; he called in a rich, clear voice, smiling broadly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to grill him with a dozen questions, starting with, &#x201c;How do you know my name?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d; and &#x201c;How did I get here?&#x201d; But I didn&#x2019;t want to reveal too much about myself and my ignorance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Call me Joshua,&#x201d; he said, extending his arm. I was struck by the strength of his grip. I couldn&#x2019;t help staring into his eyes&#x2014;morning-glory eyes, radiant blue windows of experience and knowledge and promise, deep-set eyes I could get lost in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He invited me to join a group of travelers he was with, but at the time I preferred to go farther on my own. Joshua put his arm around me. &#x201c;Go if you must,&#x201d; he said, then gave me a solemn look. &#x201c;But be careful whom you trust.&#x201d; This country, he explained, was beautiful but not always safe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here was a man with inside information, and I wanted to know what he knew. Still, for some reason, I held back from asking him. As I turned to go on my way, Joshua smiled broadly and waved his great right arm, bronzed and powerful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon I met him again, after I&#x2019;d joined another group&#x2014;the travelers on the red road who&#x2019;d shared with me that first faraway glimpse of Charis. The old man Shadrach&#x2014;who seemed overly confident about what was true and what wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;had warned me against nearly everything I found interesting, including spending time with Joshua. But by now I wasn&#x2019;t sure about the red road and where it led, and I certainly wasn&#x2019;t sure I wanted to stay in the company of those travelers, Shadrach in particular. I told Joshua, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to check out some other options.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be happy to serve as your guide,&#x201d; he answered. He led me off the red road and down a series of roads that were gray&#x2014;roads that promised me all the things I&#x2019;d ever wanted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we first set out, Joshua pointed ahead and told me, &#x201c;Lead the way, my friend.&#x201d; Though he was my guide, he showed me respect by walking to my side, a step behind me, giving me a sense of control. I liked that.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in conquer mode, so we marched down the terrain at a fast clip. It was a plunging path at first, filled with sharp turns and lined with thornbushes that kept nipping at my pant legs. After an hour, we hadn&#x2019;t reached a single rise in the trail.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Does this path only go down?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua laughed and answered, &#x201c;To the very heart of things!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The path kept descending, and our pace kept accelerating.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after dropping into a treacherous bog, we came to an intersecting path that rose upward toward firmer ground. Reaching the top of a slope and emerging from some trees, I came to a halt. Before me, positioned amid a half-dozen towering spires of rock, stood a glass and granite high-rise building. The sight of it was dreamlike yet so vivid, down to every detail. As I walked toward the structure, heart pounding, I stopped abruptly. This was the office building where I worked! I&#x2019;d never seen it like this, isolated from the surrounding cityscape, as if it had been uprooted by some alien power and transported here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I entered the familiar ground-level front door with Joshua a step behind. We took the elevator to the twenty-fifth floor, and I instinctively walked through the maze of work stations toward my corner office. Joshua gazed approvingly at the view through the windows towering beside us. &#x201c;You belong here, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he asked me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded. This was my world, and I had sailed its waters as expertly as any sea captain had ever commanded his ship and his men.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside my office, Joshua said with a gesture of his hand, &#x201c;This is what you were made for, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I could answer, my attention was drawn to a photograph on the desk, a picture of my wife and two children. It had been taken three years earlier, when we still lived together. I hadn&#x2019;t been able to get away from the office that day to make the appointment at the studio, but my wife told the photographer to take the picture anyway. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more realistic with just the three of us,&#x201d; she said to me later, twisting the knife.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua and I left the office. But after stepping off the elevator and out the front door, everything went out of focus&#x2014;until I suddenly found myself with Joshua in my condo, listening to classical music. The absence of transition made me think I must be dreaming, yet I was completely lucid, and my blue recliner was as tangible as could be, right down to the little coffee stain on the right arm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a few hours, I was immersed in a whirlpool of melancholy and reflection, going wherever the melodies led, over the mountains and valleys and through the deserts of my life. Especially the deserts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The music&#x2019;s beautiful, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Joshua said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes. Beautiful.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed him as he walked down a hallway lined on one side with oak shelves filled with books. &#x201c;Commendable,&#x201d; Joshua commented as he pulled out volumes here and there. &#x201c;You have a genuine thirst for truth.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fixed those radiant blue eyes on me. &#x201c;I know you can find what you seek on one of the roads traveled by the great minds. Choose any of them. I&#x2019;ll take you there in an instant. And if you don&#x2019;t like one of them, I&#x2019;ll take you to the next and then the next.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason I shook my head, believing there was something more I wanted, something no great thinker could lead me to.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner had I turned down this offer than we materialized back on a gray road. Before us stood more buildings rising up from the rocks and sagebrush. We entered a maze of mall interiors, where my eyes were drawn to displays of home theaters, power tools, antique guns, shiny knives, snow skis, camping gear, sports clothing. We looked over a balcony to see spotlights zooming over showroom floors filled with the latest-model cars and pickup trucks, boats and RVs, snowmobiles and motorcycles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the spotlights melted into marquee lights. Joshua and I walked into a fine restaurant filled with people in fine clothes drinking fine wines. My heart suddenly buoyed when I saw a woman alone at one of the tables, a woman who&#x2019;d been part of the group of travelers I was with earlier. She looked so beautiful tonight, so slight and delicate, dressed so elegantly. I studied every inch of her. The longer I looked, the more she filled my heart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Go sit with her,&#x201d; Joshua suggested. He led me by the arm and took me to her table, then excused himself. &#x201c;I have other things to take care of.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman seemed pleased to see me. We dined alone and toasted with champagne. When the music began, we danced. I felt intoxicated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kissed me, then smiled and said she had to go.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Can I...go with you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Not tonight,&#x201d; she whispered, but she smiled as she walked away, and her eyes said yes.</p><h2>Blood Sweep (Posadas County Mysteries, 20)</h2><p><p>Gifted fifteen-year-old Francisco Guzman has become an internationally renowned concert pianist, touring the world under the auspices of his music conservatory.

The Posadas County mysteries are carefully plotted, subtly written, and populated by an endearing, evolving cast of characters. A worthy entry in a fine series that appeals equally to procedural fans and to those who favor mysteries with a small-town setting. (Wes Lukowsky <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>In Havill&#x2019;s engrossing 20th mystery set in New Mexico&#x2019;s Posadas County (after 2013&#x2019;s NightZone), cop Estelle Reyes-Guzman is so busy that she can&#x2019;t take the persistent phone calls from her local bank. When she finally does, she gets her first hint that something&#x2019;s wrong. Estelle&#x2019;s 99-year-old mother, Teresa Reyes, has requested a cashier&#x2019;s check for $8,000 drawn from her savings account. Teresa says that a colleague of Estelle&#x2019;s, a colonel in the Mexican judiciales, requested the money. To add to her worries, Estelle&#x2019;s younger son tells her that a man claiming to be her uncle called looking for his niece. The story line is satisfyingly complex, but the novel&#x2019;s great strength is its well- rendered setting, from the opening description of a silent, motionless antelope to the evocation of a dry riverbed. The concluding note of empathy for the many people trying to cross the border is moving without being heavy-handed.

The protagonist is Julian Mantle, a high-profile attorney with a whacked-out schedule and a shameful set of spiritual priorities. Of course it takes a crisis (heart attack) to give Mantle pause. And pause he does--suddenly selling all his beloved possessions to trek India in pursuit of a meaningful existence. The Himalayan gurus along the way give simple advice, such as, "What lies behind you and what lies before you is nothing compared to what lies within you." Yet it is easy to forgive the story's simplicity because each kernel of wisdom is framed to address the persistent angst of Western white-collar professionals. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Here is the story of Julian Mantle, a superstar lawyer whose out-of-balance lifestyle leads him to a near-fatal heart attack in a packed courtroom. His physical collapse brings him into a spiritual crisis that forces him to confront the condition of his life. Hoping to find happiness and fulfillment, he embarks upon an extraordinary odyssey to an ancient culture, where he discovers a powerful system to release the potential of his mind, body, and soul and learns to live with passion, purpose, and peace. Brilliantly blending ancient spiritual wisdom of the east with contemporary success principles of the West, this inspiring tale provides a step-by-step approach to living with greater courage, balance, abundance and joy.</p><h2>Takedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage</h2><p><p>We are witnessing a watershed moment in American cultural history: the sabotaging of family and marriage. Extreme-left radicals have made their arguments and tried different tactics, from the early nineteenth century to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, but at long last they have the vehicle to make it happen: gay marriage. Now, as the legal definition of marriage rapidly changes, the floodgates are open, and the fundamental transformation of the American family will take on new speed and new dimensions. Efforts to redefine the family structure have been long at work, and there have been some influential forces on the far left and communist left that cannot and should not be ignored in that process.</p><p>In&nbsp;<i>T</i><i>akedown</i>&nbsp;Paul Kengor exposes these origins, starting with Karl Marx, and traces them through the sordid history of people like Margaret Sanger, Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse, and assorted '60s radicals. What were once fringe concepts have become accepted by mainstream thought and are today welcomed by many legislators and judges. Kengor&nbsp;notes how in the not-so-distant past, today's leftists who are attacking traditional marriage would have loudly raised their voices but not caused any real damage. They would have been dismissed with no serious concern as left-wing cranks, crackpot German and Austrian atheistic philosophers and campus agitators. But now, with formal legalization of same-sex marriage afoot, they are getting what they&#x2019;ve wanted for generations: the literal redefinition of the family.</p><p><i>Takedown</i>&nbsp;exposes how gay marriage is serving as a Trojan horse for the far left to secure the final takedown of marriage that it has long wanted, and countless everyday Americans are oblivious to the deeper forces at work. Takedown takes no prisoners and bluntly shows the reader that even Karl Marx and his more anti-marriage comrade Engels would be dumbfounded at the mere thought that modern Americans would gladly join them in their rejection of God's design for natural marriage and the family.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Kengor</b>&nbsp;is a bestselling author whose works include &#x201c;11 Principles of a Reagan Conservative,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Communist: Frank Marshall Davis: the Untold Story of Barack Obama's Mentor.&#x201d; His articles regularly appear in publications ranging from USA Today to The New York Times, plus numerous academic journals. A frequent commentator on television and radio, Kengor earned his bachelor&#x2019;s degree and Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh and his master&#x2019;s from American University.</p>"Paul Kengor offers a lively, yet sober, analysis of the most controversial social issue of our day, gay marriage. He traces the intellectual origins of the movement to redefine marriage, and how it has unfolded in recent times. His analysis of how the contributions of left-wing thinkers and political operatives found their way into mainstream American thought is masterful. Importantly, Kengor examines the way leading Catholic figures, such as Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, saw how the destabilization of marriage and the family was aided by, and served the interests of, Communism. This is one of the book's greatest strengths: Kengor's weaving of the political with the cultural.&nbsp;<i>Takedown&nbsp;</i>deserves a major place in all future discussions on this subject." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Bill Donohue, Ph.D.</b>, President Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights<br><br>"Paul Kengor does an excellent job of tying historic events and personalities together to make a coherent tale of what happened to America in the 20th century, from John Dewey and his effect on public&nbsp;education, to Herbert Marcuse and the Communist influence, to Betty Friedan and the feminists&#x2019; attack on marriage and motherhood, and to the voices of sanity from Dr. Fred Schwarz and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Phyllis Schlafly</b>, president, Eagle Forum and author of 24 books<br><br>"America has been waiting for this book.

I am glad Paul Kenkgor is not politically correct. I hope his Takedown will hammer another nail in the coffin of &nbsp;Marxism." &#x2014;&nbsp;Lt. Gen (r) <b>Ion Mihai Pacepa</b>, author of <i>Disinformation</i><br><br>"Very few people know how many generations the war against the family has been being fought, how intensely, how seriously.

While I respectfully disagree with some of Professor Kengor's conclusions, his work shows that the dark dream of an all-powerful government with officially enforced equality is both a cause and effect of the weakening of the family. In the process, he exposes aspects of the international left that may shock even careful students of recent history." &#x2014;<b>&nbsp;Michael Medved</b>, nationally syndicated talk radio host<br><br>"Classic Kengor: researched; readable; and rivoting. This time, Paul Kengor connects the dots showing that the current push to redefine marriage is not some isolated end, but rather a coordinated means used for a larger ideological end: undermining the family and related mediating authorities so as to unleash an increasingly Leviathan State. Following the footnotes leads to one unmistakable conclusion: the Left and their Progressive friends focus on the family . . . in order to destroy it.

Kengor&#x2019;s careful research shows that the hammer used to smash the House of Marriage has been invariably accompanied by the sickle used to cut the power cables. If you want to understand the ideology behind the &#x201c;sudden&#x201d; juggernaut against the millennia-old definitions of marriage and family, get this book." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Patrick Coffin</b>, host of Catholic Answers Live and author of <i>Sex Au Naturel: What It Is and Why It&#x2019;s Good For Your Marriage</i><br><br>"Kengor&#x2019;s depth of scholarship combined with a light style make Takedown a &#x201c;must read.&#x201d; He shows what Marx only dreamt of but Lenin planned and set in motion with the Frankfurt School, their academic allies (Margaret Mead, Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse), activists (Margaret Sanger, &#x2019;60&#x2019;s feminists, The Weathermen) and finally the President of the United States. &nbsp;These all worked to change the West&#x2019;s view of sexuality. Already they have achieved more than Marx ever dreamed of or any ordinary American thought possible&#x2014;the destruction of the American family. The fall of the Berlin Wall may have seemed like the end of Marx but he is having the last laugh as his progeny tears down the our nation, law by law and family by family.

In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <i>Cup of Gold</i> (1929). After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California fictions, <i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> (1932) and <i>To a God Unknown</i> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <i>The Long Valley</i> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <i>Tortilla Flat</i> (1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <i>In Dubious Battle</i> (1936), <i>Of Mice and Men</i> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> (1939). Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <i>The Forgotten Village</i> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <i>Sea of Cortez</i> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing <i>Bombs Away</i> (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <i>The Moon Is Down</i> (1942). <i>Cannery Row</i> (1945), <i>The Wayward Bus</i> (1947), <i>The Pearl</i> (1947), <i>A Russian Journal</i> (1948), another experimental drama, <i>Burning Bright</i> (1950), and <i>The Log from the</i> Sea of Cortez (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <i>East of Eden</i> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history. The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <i>Sweet Thursday</i> (1954), <i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i> (1957), <i>Once There Was a War</i> (1958), <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> (1961), <i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i> (1962), <i>America and Americans</i> (1966), and the posthumously published <i>Journal of a Novel: The</i> East of Eden <i>Letters</i> (1969), <i>Viva Zapata!</i> (1975), <i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i> (1976), and <i>Working Days: The Journals of</i> The Grapes of Wrath (1989).

Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses. Its inhabitants are, as the man once said, &#x201c;whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches,&#x201d; by which he meant Everybody. Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, &#x201c;Saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,&#x201d; and he would have meant the same thing.</p><p>In the morning when the sardine fleet has made a catch, the purse-seiners waddle heavily into the bay blowing their whistles. The deep-laden boats pull in against the coast where the canneries dip their tails into the bay. The figure is advisedly chosen, for if the canneries dipped their mouths into the bay the canned sardines which emerge from the other end would be metaphorically, at least, even more horrifying. Then cannery whistles scream and all over the town men and women scramble into their clothes and come running down to the Row to go to work. Then shining cars bring the upper classes down: superintendents, accountants, owners who disappear into offices. Then from the town pour Wops and Chinamen and Polaks, men and women in trousers and rubber coats and oilcloth aprons. They come running to clean and cut and pack and cook and can the fish. The whole street rumbles and groans and screams and rattles while the silver rivers offish pour in out of the boats and the boats rise higher and higher in the water until they are empty. The canneries rumble and rattle and squeak until the last fish is cleaned and cut and cooked and canned and then the whistles scream again and the dripping, smelly, tired Wops and Chinamen and Polaks, men and women, straggle out and droop their ways up the hill into the town and Cannery Row becomes itself again&#x2014;quiet and magical. Its normal life returns. The bums who retired in disgust under the black cypress tree come out to sit on the rusty pipes in the vacant lot. The girls from Dora&#x2019;s emerge for a bit of sun if there is any. Doc strolls from the Western Biological Laboratory and crosses the street to Lee Chong&#x2019;s grocery for two quarts of beer. Henri the painter noses like an Airedale through the junk in the grass-grown lot for some part or piece of wood or metal he needs for the boat he is building. Then the darkness edges in and the street light comes on in front of Dora&#x2019;s&#x2014;the lamp which makes perpetual moonlight in Cannery Row. Callers arrive at Western Biological to see Doc, and he crosses the street to Lee Chong&#x2019;s for five quarts of beer.</p><p>How can the poem and the stink and the grating noise&#x2014;the quality of light, the tone, the habit and the dream&#x2014;be set down alive? When you collect marine animals there are certain flat worms so delicate that they are almost impossible to capture whole, for they break and tatter under the touch. You must let them ooze and crawl of their own will onto a knife blade and then lift them gently into your bottle of sea water. And perhaps that might be the way to write this book&#x2014;to open the page and to let the stories crawl in by themselves.</p><p><b>1</b></p><p>Lee Chong&#x2019;s grocery, while not a model of neatness, was a miracle of supply. It was small and crowded but within its single room a man could find everything he needed or wanted to live and to be happy&#x2014;clothes, food, both fresh and canned, liquor, tobacco, fishing equipment, machinery, boats, cordage, caps, pork chops. You could buy at Lee Chong&#x2019;s a pair of slippers, a silk kimono, a quarter pint of whiskey and a cigar. You could work out combinations to fit almost any mood. The one commodity Lee Chong did not keep could be had across the lot at Dora&#x2019;s.</p><p>The grocery opened at dawn and did not close until the last wandering vagrant dime had been spent or retired for the night. Not that Lee Chong was avaricious. He wasn&#x2019;t, but if one wanted to spend money, he was available. Lee&#x2019;s position in the community surprised him as much as he could be surprised. Over the course of the years everyone in Cannery Row owed him money. He never pressed his clients, but when the bill became too large, Lee cut off credit. Rather than walk into the town up the hill, the client usually paid or tried to.</p><p>Lee was round-faced and courteous. He spoke a stately English without ever using the letter R. When the tong wars were going on in California, it happened now and then that Lee found a price on his head. Then he would go secretly to San Francisco and enter a hospital until the trouble blew over. What he did with his money, no one ever knew. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t get it. Maybe his wealth was entirely in unpaid bills. But he lived well and he had the respect of all his neighbors. He trusted his clients until further trust became ridiculous. Sometimes he made business errors, but even these he turned to advantage in good will if in no other way. It was that way with the Palace Flophouse and Grill. Anyone but Lee Chong would have considered the transaction a total loss.</p><p>Lee Chong&#x2019;s station in the grocery was behind the cigar counter. The cash register was then on his left and the abacus on his right. Inside the glass case were the brown cigars, the cigarettes, the Bull Durham, the Duke&#x2019;s mixture, the Five Brothers, while behind him in racks on the wall were the pints, half pints and quarters of Old Green River, Old Town House, Old Colonel, and the favorite&#x2014;Old Tennessee, a blended whiskey guaranteed four months old, very cheap and known in the neighborhood as Old Tennis Shoes. Lee Chong did not stand between the whiskey and the customer without reason. Some very practical minds had on occasion tried to divert his attention to another part of the store. Cousins, nephews, sons and daughters-in-law waited on the rest of the store, but Lee never left the cigar counter. The top of the glass was his desk. His fat delicate hands rested on the glass, the fingers moving like small restless sausages. A broad golden wedding ring on the middle finger of his left hand was his only jewelry and with it he silently tapped on the rubber change mat from which the little rubber tits had long been worn. Lee&#x2019;s mouth was full and benevolent and the flash of gold when he smiled was rich and warm. He wore half-glasses and since he looked at everything through them, he had to tilt his head back to see in the distance. Interest and discounts, addition, subtraction he worked out on the abacus with his little restless sausage fingers, and his brown friendly eyes roved over the grocery and his teeth flashed at the customers.</p><p>On an evening when he stood in his place on a pad of newspaper to keep his feet warm, he contemplated with humor and sadness a business deal that had been consummated that afternoon and reconsummated later that same afternoon. When you leave the grocery, if you walk catty-cornered across the grass-grown lot, threading your way among the great rusty pipes thrown out of the canneries, you will see a path worn in the weeds. Follow it past the cypress tree, across the railroad track, up a chicken walk with cleats, and you will come to a long low building which for a long time was used as a storage place for fish meal. It was just a great big roofed room and it belonged to a worried gentleman named Horace Abbeville. Horace had two wives and six children and over a period of years he had managed through pleading and persuasion to build a grocery debt second to none in Monterey. That afternoon he had come into the grocery and his sensitive tired face had flinched at the shadow of sternness that crossed Lee&#x2019;s face. Lee&#x2019;s fat finger tapped the rubber mat. Horace laid his hands palm up on the cigar counter. &#x201c;I guess I owe you plenty dough,&#x201d; he said simply.</p><p>Lee&#x2019;s teeth flashed up in appreciation of an approach so different from any he had ever heard. He nodded gravely, but he waited for the trick to develop.</p><p>Horace wet his lips with his tongue, a good job from corner to corner. &#x201c;I hate to have my kids with that hanging over them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why, I bet you wouldn&#x2019;t let them have a pack of spearmint now.&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong&#x2019;s face agreed with this conclusion. &#x201c;Plenty dough,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Horace continued, &#x201c;You know that place of mine across the track up there where the fish meal is.&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong nodded. It was his fish meal.</p><p>Horace said earnestly, &#x201c;If I was to give you that place&#x2014;would it clear me up with you?&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong tilted his head back and stared at Horace through his half-glasses while his mind flicked among accounts and his right hand moved restlessly to the abacus. He considered the construction which was flimsy and the lot which might be valuable if a cannery ever wanted to expand. &#x201c;Shu,&#x201d; said Lee Chong.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, get out the accounts and I&#x2019;ll make you a bill of sale on that place.&#x201d; Horace seemed in a hurry.</p><p>&#x201c;No need papers,&#x201d; said Lee. &#x201c;I make paid-in-full paper.&#x201d;</p><p>They finished the deal with dignity and Lee Chong threw in a quarter pint of Old Tennis Shoes. And then Horace Abbeville walking very straight went across the lot and past the cypress tree and across the track and up the chicken walk and into the building that had been his, and he shot himself on a heap of fish meal. And although it has nothing to do with this story, no Abbeville child, no matter who its mother was, knew the lack of a stick of spearmint ever afterward.</p><p>But to get back to the evening. Horace was on the trestles with the embalming needles in him, and his two wives were sitting on the steps of his house with their arms about each other (they were good friends until after the funeral, and then they divided up the children and never spoke to each other again). Lee Chong stood in back of the cigar counter and his nice brown eyes were turned inward on a calm and eternal Chinese sorrow. He knew he could not have helped it, but he wished he might have known and perhaps tried to help. It was deeply a part of Lee&#x2019;s kindness and understanding that man&#x2019;s right to kill himself is inviolable, but sometimes a friend can make it unnecessary. Lee had already underwritten the funeral and sent a wash basket of groceries to the stricken families.</p><p>Now Lee Chong owned the Abbeville building&#x2014;a good roof, a good floor, two windows and a door. True it was piled high with fish meal and the smell of it was delicate and penetrating. Lee Chong considered it as a storehouse for groceries, as a kind of warehouse, but he gave that up on second thought. It was too far away and anyone can go in through a window. He was tapping the rubber mat with his gold ring and considering the problem when the door opened and Mack came in. Mack was the elder, leader, mentor, and to a small extent the exploiter of a little group of men who had in common no families, no money, and no ambitions beyond food, drink, and contentment. But whereas most men in their search for contentment destroy themselves and fall wearily short of their targets, Mack and his friends approached contentment casually, quietly, and absorbed it gently. Mack and Hazel, a young man of great strength, Eddie who filled in as a bartender at La Ida, Hughie and Jones who occasionally collected frogs and cats for Western Biological, were currently living in those large rusty pipes in the lot next to Lee Chong&#x2019;s. That is, they lived in the pipes when it was damp but in fine weather they lived in the shadow of the black cypress tree at the top of the lot. The limbs folded down and made a canopy under which a man could lie and look out at the flow and vitality of Cannery Row.</p><p>Lee Chong stiffened ever so slightly when Mack came in and his eyes glanced quickly about the store to make sure that Eddie or Hazel or Hughie or Jones had not come in too and drifted away among the groceries.</p><p>Mack laid out his cards with a winning honesty. &#x201c;Lee,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I and Eddie and the rest heard you own the Abbeville place.&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong nodded and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;I and my friends thought we&#x2019;d ast you if we could move in there. We&#x2019;ll keep up the property,&#x201d; he added quickly. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t let anybody break in or hurt anything.

For forty years she has worked with dying people and has lectured on the subject of death and dying at Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Medical School, Georgetown Medical School, and many other academic institutions. In 1990, she founded Upaya Zen Center, a Buddhist study and social action center in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1994, she founded the Project on Being with Dying, which has trained hundreds of health-care professionals in the contemplative care of dying people.Radical ecospiritual memoirs and meditations from a globe- trotting seeker of truth. Halifax (Shamanic Voices, 1991, etc.--not reviewed) boasts impressive New Age credentials: ex-wife of psychologist Stansilav Grof; former assistant to Joseph Campbell; creator of California's spiritually experimental Ojai Foundation; student of assorted shamans and of Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh (who offers a grateful introduction). During her decades of world travel--her memories here range from circumambulating a sacred Tibetan mountain to eating peyote in Mexico's Huichol Sierras--Halifax has evolved a worldview that rejects what she calls Western society's ``dualistic'' perspective in favor of one that perceives ``a self coextensive with all phenomena.'' Simply ``by being born,'' Halifax contends, we share ``the World Wound''--a state of universal suffering--that we can escape through several paths, or ``Ways'': the Way of ``Traditions''; of ``the Mountain''; of ``Language''; of ``Story''; of ``Nonduality''; of ``Protectors''; of ``Ancestors,'' and of ``Compassion.'' Each Way involves a return to ``the fruitful darkness''--the shadow side of things, found in the root truths of Native religions, in the fecundity of nature, and in the stillness of meditation. Halifax writes of these paths, and of how she's walked them, in loamy, para-poetic prose: ``Mountain's realization comes through the details of breath. Mountain appears in each step. Mountain then lives inside our bones, inside our heartdrum.'' While declarations such as these, examined in reason's cool light, can seem opaque, even wooly-headed, they gather real force as they roll over pages, ultimately offering a warm and potent testament to the author's beliefs and to a life lived vigorously for the sake of the spirit. Not for those enamored of logic and common sense. But those who wish to ``hear,'' as Halifax puts it, the ``language of the river, rock, and wind,'' will find much to listen to. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Eisler gives us a richly detailed drama of a childhood of abandonment and shame; of Byron's early days at Harrow and Cambridge; of his humiliating entry into the House of Lords at eighteen; of his adventures in the East, where he consorted with pashas and prostitutes; of his relationships with his contemporaries, among them the twenty-four-year-old Shelley and his wife, Mary; of the instant celebrity that attended the publication of the first cantos of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage; and of the almost vengeful determination with which Byron recast himself as the elegant figure that glided through Regency drawing rooms, plotted with Italian Carbonari, loved men and women, and drew sensation to him like a cloak until his death, alone and in exile, at the age of thirty-six. <br><br>Here also are the first in-depth portraits of the women--and men--Byron loved: his guilty relations with John Edleston, a young Cambridge chorister; his tempestuous affair with Lady Caroline Lamb, who was driven to madness by her love for him; his catastrophic marriage to the lovely Annabella Milbanke; his passionate incestuous relationship with his half sister, Augusta, and the tormented menage a trois they shared with his young wife; and the gentler love of his later life, Teresa Guiccioli, whom he abandoned for his life's last adventure in Missolonghi. Throughout, Eisler offers incisive analysis of Byron's poetry in the context of his extraordinary life--as hero and martyr, aristocratic aesthete and dandy, transgressive rebel fueled by forbidden substances and exiled for forbidden passions--examining in detail the stanzas that inspired his own and succeeding generations as no other writer has since Shakespeare.<br><br>A magnificent record of a towering figure, sure to stand as the definitive biography for years to come.</p><p>"Obscured by the freedom fighter, fashion leader, fallen angel, and literary bad boy, Byron the great poet has tended to be forgotten," writes Benita Eisler in the closing chapter of her monumental biography, which goes a long way toward depicting George Gordon, Lord Byron (1788-1824) in a more balanced fashion. Even in his own era, when the first edition of <i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i> sold out in three days, whispers of incest, homosexuality, and--far worse in Tory England--political radicalism grew so insistent that they drove Byron out of his homeland. Eisler's comprehensive narrative does ample justice to the impassioned love affairs that made him notorious, from his voluptuous half-sister, Augusta Leigh, to the erratic and vengeful Lady Caroline Lamb, who famously described him as "mad, bad, and dangerous to know." Let's face it, those juicy stories are half the reason we want to read about Byron, but Eisler gives us the other half, too, reminding her readers with lengthy quotes and intelligent exegesis that <i>Don Juan</i> is one of the greatest poems in English, and Byron one of the most influential and important poets. Her impeccably researched text is lucid about Byron's beliefs, candid about his faults, and persuasively ardent about his genius. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"Quite simply the best life of Byron we have." --<i>Literary Review</i><br><br>"Lively. . .vividly told. . . . A much more detailed and illuminating account of the poet's private life than any previous book."<p>--<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"A splendidly readable biography of a perpetually fascinating genius."</p><p>--<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><br><br>"[Eisler's ] book will . . . be the one to beat for many decades to come. <br>. . .

Fenster traces the history of the weakening of our national ethics through the practice of cheating. From marital infidelity to financial fraud; rigged sports competitions to corruption in politics and the American education system; nuclear weaponry to beauty pageants; hospitals, TV gameshows, and charities; nothing and no one is exempt. <br>And far from being ostracized, cheaters in every sphere continue to survive and even thrive, casting their influence over the rest of our society.

He sums up each lesson nicely in a little anecdote drawn from a professional football game or sometimes a high school basketball game.

But the young narrator's delicate and pure love for his cousin Layli is constantly jeopardized by an unforgettable cast of family members and the hilarious mayhem of their intrigues and machinations. It is also a social satire, lampooning the widespread Iranian belief that foreigners (particularly, and with some historical justification, the British) are responsible for events that occur in Iran. But most of all it is a very enjoyable, often sidesplitting read that you wish did not have to end. <p>First published in the early 1970s, My Uncle Napoleon became an all-time bestseller in Iran. In 1976 it was turned into a television series and immediately captured the imagination of the whole nation-its story became a cultural reference point and its characters national icons.</p></p><p>The most beloved Iranian novel of the twentieth century <br>"God forbid, I've fallen in love with Layli!" So begins the farce of our narrator's life, one spent in a large extended Iranian family lorded over by the blustering, paranoid patriarch, Dear Uncle Napoleon. When Uncle Napoleon's least-favorite nephew falls for his daughter, Layli, family fortunes are reversed, feuds fired up and resolved, and assignations attempted and thwarted. <br>First published in Iran in the 1970s and adapted into a hugely successful television series, this beloved novel is now "Suggested Reading" in Azar Nafisi's "Reading Lolita in Tehran. My Uncle Napoleon is a timeless and universal satire of first love and family intrigue.IRAJ PEZESHKZAD was born in Tehran in 1928, and educated in Iran and France where he received his degree in Law. He served as ajudge in the Iranian Judiciary for five years prior to joining the Iranian Foreign Service. He began writing in the early 1950s by translating the works of Voltaire and Molire into Persian and by writing short stories for magazines. His novels include Haji Mam-ja'far in Paris, and Mashalah Khan in the Court of Haroun al-Rashid. He has also written several plays and various articles on the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution. He is currently working as a journalist. <p>Translator DICK DAVIS was born to English and Italian parents in 1945 and educated at King's College, Cambridge (B.A. and M.A. in English Literature). In 1970 while pursuing a career in poetry and literature and teaching in Greece he visited a friend in Iran. While there, he fell ill and was nursed to health by a Persian woman, whom he eventually married. Davis fell in love with the country as well, and stayed for eight years, learning Persian and teaching at the University of Tehran. After the revolution in 1979 the Davis family returned to England where he pursued his love of the Persian language, earning his Ph.D. in Medieval Persian Literature from the University of Manchester. Since then, he has emerged as the foremost translator of Persian as well as having published numerous volumes of his own poetry to critical acclaim, including: Touchwood, A New Kind of Love, Devices and Desires, and Covenant. He is currently professor of Persian at Ohio State University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. His other translations from Persian include The Lion and the Throne: Stories from the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi (Mage, 1997), Borrowed Ware (Mage, 1997), My Uncle Napoleon (Mage, 1996), The Legend of Seyavash (Penguin Classics, 1992), and with Afkham Darbandi, The Conference of the Birds (Penguin Classics, 1984).</p></p><h2>The Spring Will Be Ours: Poland and the Poles from Occupation to Freedom</h2><p><p>One can think of countries that traversed the twentieth century free from war, revolution, or social upheaval. Such countries, however, are far outnumbered by those that struggled, often constantly, with severe internal conflicts, fought in bloody wars, or were attacked by their neighbors and deprived of their sovereignty. Poland is one of the more startling examples of a country subjected to a steady stream of trials and tribulations from Hitler&#x2019;s Nazi Germany through decades of Soviet repression. <em>The Spring Will Be Ours</em>, by one of Poland&#x2019;s leading historians, is the first book written after the collapse of state socialism in 1989 to tell this dramatic story based on research in newly declassified records.</p><p><em>The Spring Will Be Ours</em> focuses on the turbulent half century from the outbreak of World War II in 1939, which started the chain of events that would lead to the communist takeover of Poland, to 1989, when futile attempts to reform the communist system gave way to its total transformation. Paczkowski shows how the communists captured and consolidated power, describes their use of terror and propaganda, and illuminates the changes that took place within the governing elite. He also documents the political opposition to the regime&#x2014;both inside Poland and abroad&#x2014;that resulted in upheavals in 1956, 1968, 1970, 1976, and 1980. His narrative makes evident the pressures that the elite felt from above, from Moscow, and from below, from the population and from within the party. The history of Poland and the Poles is of special interest because on numerous occasions in the twentieth century this relatively small country influenced developments on a global scale.</p><p>First published in Poland in 1995, <em>The Spring Will Be Ours</em> has been translated into several other languages. For this edition, translated by Jane Cave, Paczkowski has added an introductory chapter on Poland&#x2019;s twenty years of independence prior to 1939 and an extensive postscript exploring the changes that have taken place since the fall of communism in 1989. A bibliography of English-language works, prepared by Padraic Kenney, makes this book an indispensable starting point for anyone seeking to understand the remarkable course of events that brought an independent Poland into the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><p>Andrzej Paczkowski is Professor at the Institute for Political Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, where he also is a member of the Board of the Institute of National Remembrance. He serves as editor of <em>Intermarium: An Online Journal of East Central European Postwar History</em> and on the editorial board of the Harvard Project on Cold War Studies. He co-authored, with St�phane Courtois, Nicolas Werth, Jean-Louis Pann�, Karel Bartosek, and Jean-Louis Margolin, <em>The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression (</em>1999).</p>&#x201c;Writing in elegant prose, Paczkowski makes persuasive comments and judgments about this half-century of Poland's history. <i>The Spring Will Be Ours</i> is a masterly work.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;John J. Kulczycki, University of Illinois at Chicago<br><br>&#x201c;A must-read for anyone interested in contemporary Polish history, or the development of the historical profession in Poland since 1989.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Michael Bernhard, University of Florida<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Spring Will Be Ours</i> is a major achievement of Polish history. It is the first attempted synthesis of a crucial period, largely falsified in the communist writings, based on newly available sources and interpretations. Paczkowski is a seasoned historian, who writes well and who shows remarkable insights into the problems of the Polish people and republic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Piotr Wandycz, Yale University<br><br>&#x201c;A masterly work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;John J. Kulczycki, University of Illinois at Chicago<br><br>&#x201c;An excellent, readable, and perceptive analysis of Poland&#x2019;s modern history. Essential to a deeper understanding of the experience and orientation of America&#x2019;s important new European ally.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. national security adviser<br><br>&#x201c;Under the communist regime, Polish historians labored to make sense of the difficult history of their country, despite censorship and official &#x2018;blank spots&#x2019; in that history. Some of that work was published by underground publishing houses, some overseas, and some was kept in desk drawers. Andrzej Paczkowski&#x2019;s book represents the historical understanding that gradually emerged in Poland in the 1970s and 1980s and reached full maturity in the years following 1989 with the removal of academic restraints and access to hitherto inaccessible sources. <i>The Spring Will Be Ours</i>, authored by one of Poland&#x2019;s leading historians, eloquently sums up this new view of history and provides major insights into the historical consciousness of the Polish intelligentsia. It is a must read for anyone interested in contemporary Polish history, or the development of the historical profession in Poland since 1989.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Michael Bernhard, Penn State<br><br>&#x201c;Here, in lucid, uncluttered, and dispassionate form, is Poland&#x2019;s political history from September 1939, when German and Soviet tanks rolled in, until 1989, when the communist regime faded out. Paczkowski, a Polish historian, treats in great detail the wartime occupation and the dramatic decade of the 1980s: in between, he deals well, if briefly, with the creation of the regime, the explosive 1950s, and the dress rehearsals of hte 1970s. His analytical restraint and unemotional judgement inspire confidence, as does his dual role as first-hand observer and professional historian. It is, however, disconcerting that a book this scholarly has no footnotes, even for direct quotations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Robert Legvold, <i>Foreign Affairs</i><br><br>&#x201c;Andrzej Paczkowski&#x2019;s measured and lightly readable narrative covers every aspect of this story, and his handling of the material is masterful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Adam Zamoyski, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>&#x201c;The book&#x2019;s strengths are great and many.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;P.W.

Calhoun: A Biography</h2><p>Examines Calhoun&#39;s childhood as an orphan, his actions during the War of 1812, and his political career</p><p>In this important and highly readable biography of John C. Calhoun, Irving Bartlett sees a man almost unique in American history, a lifelong politician who was also a profound political philosopher. Born on the South Carolina frontier, Calhoun grew up in a postrevolutionary culture which valued both African slavery and the republican ideology of the Founding Fathers. He was orphaned in his teens and, with almost no formal education, suddenly became a man. In less than ten years he had become a Yale graduate, a lawyer, a former state legislator, and a congressman-elect prepared to help James Madison lead the country into the War of 1812. As a congressman and later as James Monroe&#39;s secretary of war Calhoun articulated the nationalism of the new nation as cogently as any other American leader. Calhoun was ambitious beyond his years. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the disputed presidential election of 1824 but was easily elected vice president under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. Determined to avoid the obscurity of that office, Calhoun managed to get into monumental public disputes with both presidents and resigned in the last days of Jackson&#39;s first administration to become senator from South Carolina and champion his state&#39;s right to nullify the Tariff of 1832. Along with his famous contemporaries Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, Calhoun dominated the Senate of the United States in the 1830s and 1840s. Serving briefly as secretary of state in the beleaguered Tyler administration, he played a key role in the annexation of Texas and created a furor on both sides of the Atlantic with his strident defense of American slavery and his denunciation of what he perceived as thepseudophilanthropy of British abolitionism. Returning to the Senate, he acted as peacemaker in helping avoid a near war with Britain over the Oregon boundary dispute, and he persistently opposed the popular Mexican War. Long before his death in 1850 Calhoun had become known as the cast-iron leader of the South, who never curried to popular opinion, spurned party loyalty, and defended slavery and states&#39; rights with a vigor and intelligence that even leading abolitionists had to respect. In this major new biography Irving Bartlett goes behind the cast-iron image to explain the cultural and psychological forces that shaped Calhoun&#39;s political career and thought; he maintains that however wrong Calhoun was about slavery, many of his ideas still speak to us today.A scholarly, limpid life of the southern statesman and nullifier. Bartlett (American Civilization/UMass at Boston; Daniel Webster, 1978) tries his engaging best at a tough task: to bring to life someone who was called ``the cast-iron man'' by his own contemporaries. Born to Irish immigrants who'd settled in South Carolina and become wealthy and prominent, Calhoun (1782-1850) studied at Yale and, though an adherent of Jeffersonian republicanism, at the heavily Federalist Litchfield Law School. Soon disenchanted with the law's pedantry, he entered public life, assuming office in the US House of Representatives soon after marrying his second cousin and becoming one of the largest plantation masters in South Carolina. Bartlett, while only glancing at his subject's personal life, covers in rapid succession the series of crises that shaped Calhoun's evolution from avid nationalist to champion of sectionalism and nullification, and that thrust him into prominence: his career as a war hawk in the House, which helped propel the country into the War of 1812; his turbulent term as secretary of war under Monroe, which led him into fateful confrontations with Andrew Jackson over Jackson's headstrong Florida policy; his stints as Vice President under John Quincy Adams and Jackson, during which he advocated the power of states to nullify federal laws; and his years as a senatorial defender of slavery and the southern way of life. Bartlett also points out that Calhoun, in his term as secretary of state under Tyler, became one of the architects of the policy that led to the annexation of Texas as a slave state. Finally, Calhoun returned to the Senate, continued to shape public opinion on the Mexican War, and in his Disquisition on Government (1848) achieved the ultimate expression of his views on nullification. Bartlett paints Calhoun as many of his peers no doubt viewed him: brilliant, utterly absorbed in politics and personal ambition, formidable--even admirable in many ways--but not very likable. A fine contribution to antebellum scholarship. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Called to the funeral of Yost Yoder, an Amish cousin in Farmersburg, Ohio, Magdalena is accompanied on the trip by her wayward sister Susannah and housekeeper Freni. Yost had drowned, naked, in a milk tank on his farm--this only days after young Levi Mast, on the eve of his wedding, had fallen from a silo to his death. There's subdued talk among friends and relatives of the strange behavior of the two before they died. By the time the funeral is over, snow has closed the highway home--a perfect excuse for Magdalena to visit around, asking questions, while Susannah, hormones rampant, gets herself involved with feckless Danny Hern, heir to the once highly praised Daisybell Dairy, now on a slide that had persuaded Yost and Levi to form their own dairy co-op. In the midst of it all, Danny vanishes--escaping from a promised elopement to Aruba, according to Susannah, who manages to make do with big-eared sheriff Marvin Stoltzfus. A lot more happens--little of it making much sense--before a kooky, inept plot is uncovered and Magdalena is reunited with the PennDutch Inn and handsome suitor Aaron Miller--her Pooky Bear. There are poignant moments and an occasional smile here, but the story will be most enjoyed by readers with high sugar tolerance and a fondness for archly self-deprecating stand-up comedy. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

For over twenty-five years, Howard Snyder's <em>Community of the King</em> has set the standard for a penetrating look at the relationship between the kingdom of God and the earthly church. Biblically and practically Snyder helps us think through such crucial questions as <ul> <li>What is the kingdom of God?</li> <li>What role does it play in history?</li> <li>What does it mean for the church to be an agent of the kingdom?</li> </ul> Once we grasp the nature of the kingdom, Snyder helps us explore its implications for the church as we experience it in daily life. The church, he argues, is part of God's dramatic plan to reconcile all things to himself. The church that is true to its calling will emphasize the God-given gifts of all its members and develop structures and strategies that reflect God's reign in the world. In addition to a completely new chapter on developments in Christian thinking on the church since its first publication, this new edition of <em>Community of the King</em> contains a fully updated bibliography and is revised throughout. Here is a classic book for all concerned with church life and growth.</p><p>Howard A.

This Gothic tale of goddesses and sorcery is ably read by Laura Esterman. Her ethereal voice is well matched to the tale. She narrates in a slow, expressive style, which becomes more animated as the strange events unfold.

The author&#39;s intention, from chapter to chapter, is to underscore the necessity of an active, abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Tozer reaches into his personal experience as he applies the rich truths of key texts from the final chapters of the letter to the Hebrews. This book is a companion volume to Jesus, Our Man in Glory, which is based on the earlier chapters of Hebrews. Together, the two books examine most of the important emphases in the significant Letter.</p><p><b>A.W. TOZER</b> began his lifelong pursuit of God at the age of seventeen after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio. A self-taught theologian, Tozer was a pastor, writer and editor whose powerful use of words continues to grip the intellect and stir the soul of today's reader. Among his best-loved books are the classics <i>The Pursuit of God</i> and <i>The Attributes of God</i>.<b>GERALD B. SMITH</b> was a prolific writer and editor, most widely known for his A. W.

Instead of throwing his life away, he decides to spend all his time and effort disposing of those who he feels deserve to die. Targeting a bureaucrat in the Veterans&#x2019; Administration, he devises an ingenious method of murdering people without trace.

After a career in the merchant marine cut short by illness, he achieved international recognition for <i>Last Exit To Brooklyn</i>. His other novels include <i>The Room</i> in 1971, <i>The Demon</i> in 1976, <i>The Willow Tree</i> in 1998 and a collection of stories, <i>Song of the Silent Snow</i>, in 1986, all published by Marion Boyars.Selby's latest offers a chilling look into the mind of a killer, as the author of Last Exit to Brooklyn uses stream-of-consciousness first-person narration to slowly transform his anonymous male narrator from a paranoid, disaffected war veteran into a deranged murderer. The catalytic event that initiates the transformation is the narrator's attempt to purchase a gun to commit suicide, but when a brief waiting period ensues, he decides instead to get even with his various tormentors. The first target is the bureaucrat at the Veterans Administration who has been denying the narrator his benefits, an alleged injustice he remedies by slipping the man a lethal dose of E. coli bacteria. The narrator goes through a brief period of killer's remorse, during which he almost confesses to a newsstand operator, but once his jitters pass, he targets a local TV celebrity for another dose of lethal bacteria. From there he goes completely over the edge, building a homemade crossbow as he explores the feasibility of using explosives to facilitate similar attacks in various cities around the country. Selby's style is relentless, harrowing and frighteningly effective, albeit somewhat monotonous and tough to read; this might have been a better novel if Selby had introduced some secondary characters and broken up the first-person narrative into chapters built around each incident. Still, in a world in which the reach of terrorism seems to grow on a daily basis, this story is a disturbing reminder of how vulnerable we are to attacks from the discontented and deranged, regardless of their location or nationality.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Trout Streams of Southern Appalachia</h2><p>When Trout Unlimited rated the 100 best trout streams in the United States, nine of its choices were in the southern Appalachians, In this book veteran angler and writer Jimmy Jacobs takes readers to these famous rivers and to many lesser known waters in this five-state region, which boasts some of the finest fly-fishing anywhere in North America. In preparing this first comprehensive fly-angler's guide to the area, Jacobs drove over 25,000 miles, hiked hundreds more, and consulted with many state fisheries managers and knowledgeable local anglers. Features include 37 chapters on the region's major river systems; a clear map and detailed access information for each river and in productive tributaries; information on hatches, other trout foods, and the most effective patterns for individual streams; access points to streams with light to nonexistent fishing pressure and tips for avoiding elbow to elbow conditions on the more famous rivers; discussion of casting and wading conditions; and coverage of adjacent regions, including the Cumberland Plateau of Kentucky and Tennessee and the Carolina foothills. George-born Jimmy Jacobs has been fishing the streams and rivers of the Southern highlands for 25 years.

Hundreds of thousands of people took heed, joining religious cults and anti-governmental militias in preparation for the coming war between good and evil. (If this sounds familiar, it is proof only that history is cyclical.) During this heady time, Europe exploded in religious war, peasant revolts and sectarian strife, marked by the first large-scale massacres of Jews and gypsies, the first inklings of inquisitions and holy crusades. Norman Cohn, a masterful writer and interpreter, carefully explores this extraordinary period in European history in a book that bears rereading as our own millennium approaches its end.This fascinating book explores the millenarianism that flourished in Western Europe between the eleventh and sixteenth centuries.</p><h2>Untie My Heart</h2><p><p>Stuart Aysgarth, the new Viscount Mount Villiars, doesn't know he's playing with fire when he inadvertently runs afoul of Emma Hotchkiss. True, the exquisite Yorkshire lady is a mere sheep farmer, but she also guards a most colorful past that makes her only more appealing to the handsome, haunted lord. Emma has come to him seeking justice -- and Stuart is determined that she will not leave until she has shared her secrets ... and his bed. Her clever revenge scheme <em>must</em> fail in the face of his soft words and tender caress -- and then he turns the tables on his bewitching adversary, seducing her into a daring deception of his own ...</p></p><p><p>Judith Ivory's work has won many honors, including the Romance Writers of America's RITA and Top Ten Favorite Books of the Year awards and <em>Romantic Times</em> Reviewers' Choice Award. </p>Set against the colorful backdrop of Victorian Britain, Ivory's (The Indiscretion, etc.) sensual tale begins when the handsome and exotic Stuart Aysgarth, Lord Mount Villiars, returns from Russia to claim his inheritance from a dissolute father, only to find that his shady Uncle Leonard is stealing from the estate. While Stuart attempts to untie the resulting financial tangles, his coach accidentally kills a valuable lamb owned by luscious young widow Emma Hotchkiss, a former confidence woman now living a quiet life in Yorkshire. Emma tries to recoup her financial loss by means both fair and, eventually, foul; Stuart turns the discovery that she has cooked his books to his own advantage, threatening her with exposure if she doesn't help him double-cross the oily Leonard. As their schemes mature, the two engage in a series of sexual games. The delightfully complex con that forms the story's liveliest element isn't introduced until halfway through the narrative, and the novel's sparkle is occasionally dimmed by expository and noticeably anachronistic prose. Still, the playful roguishness of both protagonists adds a wickedly welcome twist to the familiar historical romance formula, while Ivory's gift for creating passionate (even outr&#x201a;) sexual interludes is sure to please readers who prefer their romances warmly spiced.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Neverworld Wake</h2><p><b><b>Five friends.

Population: You Know Everyone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My great-grandfather Burn Hartley opened the parlor in 1885, when Watch Hill was little more than a craggy hamlet where whaling captains came to shake off their sea legs and hold their children for the first time before taking off again for the Atlantic&#x2019;s Great Unknowns. Burn&#x2019;s framed pencil portrait hangs over the entrance, revealing him to have the mad glare of some dead genius writer, or a world explorer who never came home from the Arctic.

They came and went in big skittish groups like schools of fish. I made cheeseburgers and tuna melts, coleslaw and milk shakes. I swept away sand dusting the black-and-white-checkered floor. I threw out napkins, ketchup packets, salt packets, over-21 wristbands, Del&#x2019;s Frozen Lemonade cups, deep-sea fishing party boat brochures. I put lost cell phones beside the register so they could be easily found when the panic-stricken owners came barging inside: &#x201c;I lost my . . .

I Cloroxed and Fantasticked and Mr. Cleaned the windows and counters and doorknobs. I dusted the brine off the mussels and the clams, polishing every one like a gemstone dealer obsessively inspecting emeralds. Most days I rose at five and went with my dad to pick out the day&#x2019;s seafood when the fishing boats came in, inspecting crab legs and fluke, oysters and bass, running my hands over their tapping legs and claws, barnacles and iridescent bellies. I composed song lyrics for a soundtrack to a made-up movie called Lola Anderson&#x2019;s Highway Robbery, drawing words, rhymes, faces, and hands on napkins and take-out menus, tossing them in the trash before anyone saw them. I attended grief support group for adolescents at the North Stonington Community Center. There was only one other kid in attendance, a silent boy named Turks whose dad had died from ALS.

This is a story of a couple who became successful through hard work and perseverance.</p><p>Campaigning for the 1988 presidential election, the Doles here express their experience and platform. Alternately by chapter, both proclaim their centrist views and traditional, small-town American roots. Bob stresses that his war handicap and rural Kansas upbringing made him realize that unfortunate things happen to good people and government must help. But he strongly identifies with Reganomics. Ex-cabinet and White House official Elizabeth describes herself as a very capable woman, i.e., well equipped to be First Lady. Despite the campaign autobiography aspects, the Doles tell an interesting story. This and Bob's prominent status for the Republican nomination recommend the book for most libraries.Mark K.

Boyle exploring the first scientific and recreational forays into LSD and its mind-altering possibilities</strong> </p><p>In this stirring and insightful novel, T.C. Boyle takes us back to the 1960s and to the early days of a drug whose effects have reverberated widely throughout our culture: LSD. </p><p>In 1943, LSD is synthesized in Basel. Two decades later, a coterie of grad students at Harvard are gradually drawn into the inner circle of renowned psychologist and psychedelic drug enthusiast Timothy Leary. Fitzhugh Loney, a psychology Ph.D. student and his wife, Joanie, become entranced by the drug&#x2019;s possibilities such that their &#x201c;research&#x201d; becomes less a matter of clinical trials and academic papers and instead turns into a free-wheeling exploration of mind expansion, group dynamics, and communal living. With his trademark humor and pathos, Boyle moves us through the Loneys&#x2019; initiation at one of Leary&#x2019;s parties to his notorious summer seminars in Zihuatanejo until the Loneys&#x2019; eventual expulsion from Harvard and their introduction to a communal arrangement of thirty devotees&#x2014;students, wives, and children&#x2014;living together in a sixty-four room mansion and devoting themselves to all kinds of experimentation and questioning.</p><p>Is LSD a belief system? Does it allow you to see God? Can the Loneys&#x2019; marriage&#x2014;or any marriage, for that matter&#x2014;survive the chaotic and sometimes orgiastic use of psychedelic drugs? Wry, witty, and wise, <em>Outside Looking In</em> is an ideal subject for this American master, and highlights Boyle&#x2019;s acrobatic prose, detailed plots, and big ideas. It&#x2019;s an utterly engaging and occasionally trippy look at the nature of reality, identity, and consciousness, as well as our seemingly infinite capacities for creativity, re-invention, and self-discovery. </p></p><p><p>T.C. Boyle has published fourteen novels and ten collections of short stories. He won the PEN/Faulkner award in 1988 for his novel <em>World&#x2019;s End</em>, and the Prix M�dicis �tranger for <em>The Tortilla Curtain</em> in 1995, as well as the 2014 Henry David Thoreau award for excellence in nature writing.

Starting in West Africa, the origin of over 50% of American slaves, Watkins follows the migration of black humor, its meaning, function, evolution in the South, and its influence on the white culture. An irreverent and aggressive private humor helped blacks survive, and Watkins contrasts this private humor with the public one--the submissive, naive, inept, ridiculous stereotypes that appeared in minstrel shows and later black comics. Thus Watkins offers a particularly potent example of how an endangered race survived by assuming the image created by its adversary: theories from Freud, Bergson, Langston Hughes, even Stepin Fetchit explain the gradual transformation of this public humor in various media- -black clubs, silent films, radio, TV, records, ``genre films''-- and its new meaning to blacks and to their audiences. The public and private merge in the impious and outrageous style of the 70's, the cerebral Dick Gregory; the vulgar, slapstick, and power images of Whoopi Goldberg, Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby, and Richard Pryor, to whom a final and eloquent chapter is devoted. Watkins's style is personal and vivid, and his eye for human detail animates whole sections on Harlem and the Apollo Theater, folk and street humor, early television, the ironic and ambivalent fascination of whites with black life, and their love affair with black entertainers of all sorts, from Lena Horne to Flip Wilson. A careful balance of example and commentary--as filled with the voices and laughter of black humor as with the pain, injustice, indignities, and exclusion that gave rise to it. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Declaring that African American humor "shadows, satirizes and humanizes America's main body," Watkins delivers a rich and ambitious history of such humor both in the mainstream media and in the black community. A former editor at the New York Times , he draws on prodigious research to describe such aspects of black humor as the African sources of slave wordplay, the sources of the minstrel tradition, the Negro caricatures of Hollywood silent films and the controversy over Amos 'n' Andy. He examines the contributions of the oft-forgotten early 20th-century comedian Bert Williams and the brillant Richard Pryor, and ventures into such topics as literary humor and street folklore. Because Watkins's research is so deep and his interest historical, his study of the varieties (and controversies) in black comedy after Richard Pryor is brief. This extensive compilation makes a valuable contribution to our cultural history.

Krista Landingham, his former partner on the Santa Barbara Police Department, is dead. When Rick goes to the funeral in the city where his wife was murdered and where he is seen as guilty for her death in the eyes of the police, he discovers that Krista&#x2019;s death may not have been a tragic accident, but murder.

By 1944, all three Tessier siblings find themselves involved with the Resistance movement. Paul's espionage activities include serving as a courier and creating drawings that detail important logistical information for the underground forces. Sylvie, under the guise of dating a German soldier, is able to obtain sensitive enemy intelligence. Marie discovers a pilot from a downed Resistance aircraft and hides him in the wine cellar. Everyone has secrets and all are involved in political and personal intrigue. Paul's accomplice, Jacques, succinctly sums it up, saying, "the best allies in this war are those you don't trust." The climactic conclusion takes Paul and Jacques to Paris where they meet former coconspirator Henri and witness de Gaulle's triumphal march through the streets of the city. The story reaches a satisfying visual and emotional finale with the illumination of the Eiffel Tower, after four years of darkness. The expressive faces of the characters convey the tension during those days. Purvis effectively uses two color palettes: darker muted colors to depict night scenes and subversive activity and lighter, brighter daylight scenes. While the three volumes work together to tell a story of one family and its community involvement during the German occupation of France, this final installment stands as a discrete story for those not familiar with the first two volumes.

Learn to hook a simple design on a Checkerboard Pillow; add a border and practice finishing techniques on a Circle and Star Rug; hook a face on a Rug Doll. Go beyond the basics and try larger, more detailed projects. Turn rugs into wearables. Use polka dots or a thin strip of wool tied onto a bow to make textured pieces even more dimensional.

And there's a lot more, too, from table mats and purses to an unusually shaped Welcome Rug.<br></p><p>Once again, Chapelle Studios has its finger on the pulse of America, this time spotlighting the art of rug hooking. Californian Lovelady acts as guide, narrating via a familiar format of basics, techniques, questions and answers, and gallery of artists' examples. The work here, 24 projects as demonstrated through Q&amp;As, is definitely and defiantly primitive, reminiscent of the outsider art popularized in the last 10 or so years. There are all sorts of simple shapes, like hearts and bears and houses, as well as more complicated forms, such as a 3-D doll. Most are finished as rugs or wall hangings; a few--a ladybug purse, for instance--transcend "cuteness" into attractive utilitarianism.

Barnett demonstrates that the practice and methods of historiography are intimately linked to the practice and methods of theology, and he recommends a thorough investigation of all the sources relevant to both disciplines. Part of the problem with the plethora of idiosyncratic Jesus figures is that they are reconstructions based on a narrow, and often questionable, band of sources. Barnett advocates a reading of history that takes seriously the relationship between the historical Jesus and the movement that came to view him as Messiah and Lord. He also seeks to redress an imbalance in Historical Jesus studies by giving the New Testament epistles - the earliest documents that relate directly to the historical figure of Jesus - the weight that they deserve.</p><p>Paul Barnett is the Anglican bishop of North Sydney, Australia.&#34;Barnett offers important contributions to the manner in which we may responsibly work as both historians and theologians to understand not only the nascent Christian church, but also the historical Jesus whom they confessed . . .

In his fifth collection (Restoration, 1992, etc.) of short- take commentaries (drawn largely from work published in Newsweek and the Washington Post over the past four years), the syndicated columnist addresses a wealth of consequential issues. To a great extent, however, Will's varied pieces are linked by his concern about the chill, leveling winds of cultural change now whistling through contemporary American society. Informed by a classically conservative sensibility, the author inveighs against the epidemic of illegitimate births, promotion of group (rather than individual) rights, the desensitizing effects of represented violence, the politicization of education, the coarsening of popular entertainment, and the socioeconomic costs of urban decay. Other targets of opportunity include George Bush (who, Will feels, Desert Storm notwithstanding, effectively squandered Ronald Reagan's legacy), Bill Clinton (whose on-again/off-again liberalism earns him comparison with Henry of Navarre, one of history's slicker chameleons), quota systems (whether ethnic, racial, or sexual), interventionist government, Patrick Buchanan, political agendas tarted up to pass as civil rights, the proliferation of victim status, and academe's tenured radicals. If Will finds considerable fault with the latter-day US, he does not ignore the plus side of the ledger altogether (noting at one point that journalists seldom report on all the planes that land safely). By way of example, he celebrates many of the dedicated individuals who work with underclass kids on the mean streets of inner cities that have long since lost their alabaster gleam. The Pulitzer Prizewinning author also has kind words for meritocracy (wherever observed), free trade, traditional family values, Andrew Jackson, Thomas Jefferson (whom he designates the man of the millennium), Harry Truman, and other icons whose libertarian appeal may not be readily apparent to casual students of ideology. Articulately partisan critiques of the volatile and evolving state of the union. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Will may be the best-sounding American political pundit. To prove the point, read him aloud. You can't help putting a tone to every one of his sentences--ironic, earnest, rueful, fervid, and so forth--but a tone that alters pitch and timbre. If you do this exercise with this volume, try its two longer, keynote pieces, a speech on the legacy of Thomas Jefferson and another on how the U.S. got from Jeffersonian yeoman-farmer democracy to Ronald Reagan. Both pieces voice bedrock American conservatism about as intelligently, succinctly, and humanely as anyone could wish. They also, like one after another of the shorter pieces--Will's columns for the <i>Washington Post</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>--tell us things we may have forgotten, such as, in the Reagan speech, that Republicans created big federal government during and after the Civil War, handing it over to Wilsonian Democrats just in time for the income tax's adoption in 1913. In the reprinted columns, Will also often provides estimable reader's advisory service by reporting on his own wide-ranging reading, or he offers fresh insights into public figures both current and historic, or he charms us with a day at the beach with a toddler--his youngest son. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The Wittgenstein House</h2><p>In 1926 philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein designed and built a house in Vienna for his sister. The only building designed by Wittgenstein, it crystallized his philosophy of architecture&#x2014;notable for its clarity, precision, and austerity&#x2014;and served as a foil for his written work.?<p>This detailed investigation of the house is based on 30 years of extensive research. It examines the formal properties of the structure, including Wittgenstein's attention to proportion, detail, and color. It is also the story of one man's relationship to this extraordinary building: in 1971, author Bernhard Leitner was instrumental in saving the Wittgenstein House from destruction and having it declared a national landmark. In the years since, he has continuously refined his ideas about the house and its architect. The beautifully printed photographs in this volume allow a true appreciation of this icon of modern design.

An American artist, Andrea Zittel is best known as a builder of "living systems." From furniture to trailers to a man-made island, Zittel&#x2019;s structures are created as investigations into what humans need to survive. This exhibition catalog features numerous images from Zittel&#x2019;s project in the desert near Joshua Tree, California, known as "A-Z West." For nearly a decade she has been creating minimal self-sufficient dwelling spaces in which everyday actions such as sleeping, eating, cooking, bathing and socializing are transformed into acts of art. This volume documents the results of these experiments years after their inception. Also featured are images of Zittel&#x2019;s other projects, including her Uniform series, High Desert Test Sites, and the Wagon Station Project. The result is an up-to-date retrospective on this exciting artist.</p><p>Blurring the line between art and life, Andrea Zittel&#x2019;s fascinating experiments in functional living showcase her preoccupation with self-sufficiency and adaptability.RICHARD JULIN is Deputy Director and Chief Curator at Magasin 3 Stockholm Konsthall.</p><h2>Opus Posthumous: Poems, Plays, Prose (Enlarged, Revised, Corrected)</h2><p>When Opus Posthumous first appeared in 1957, it was an appropriate capstone to the career of one of the most important writers of the twentieth century.

He was there. He lived it. <br><br>Bill Bonanno was born into a world of respect, tradition, and honor. The son of legendary mafioso Joe Bonanno, Bill was a "made" member of the Mafia by the time he was in his early twenties. He was rumored to be the model for <i>The Godfather'</i>s Michael Corleone and was the subject of Gay Talese's best-selling <i>Honor Thy Father.</i><br><br>Now retired, Bill is finally ready to give an eyewitness account of his life as a high-ranking captain in the Bonanno crime family, one of America's most powerful Mafia syndicates. He takes you inside the mob at its peak, when New York's Five Families-Bonanno, Gambino, Colombo, Lucchese, and Genovese-not only dominated local businesses, but also controlled national politics. For the first time, Bill Bonanno discloses the machinations behind his marriage to Rosalie Profaci (niece of the powerful don Joe Profaci), and even that cemented the alliance between the two Families with all the pomp and circumstance of a royal wedding. From the truth about the mysterious disappearance of his father to a startling disclosure about he mob's participation in the Kennedy assassination, Bill Bonanno lays bare the inner workings of his chaotic, violent, and surprisingly human world with unparalleled detail and insight. <br><br><i>Bound By Honor </i>not only recounts Bill Bonanno's tumultuous life, but also is an engrossing chronicle of organized crime. Bonanno's story provides a remarkable glimpse into all of the intriguing personalities of the underworld of yesterday to today, from Bugsy Siegel to John Gotti.<br><br>This book is a must for readers of Mario Puzo, Gay Talese, Nicholas Pileggi, and others who have written abut the Mafia, but who have never been in the eye of the storm in quite the same way as Bill Bonanno in <i>Bound By Honor.</i><br></p><p>Bill Bonanno could be just another 66-year-old retiree, gone to Tucson, Arizona, to live out his remaining years in a hospitable climate. But he's not. "I come from a long line of Mafiosi," he informs us, taking pains to establish the difference between <i>Mafiosi</i>, a term "rooted in the character and the values of the men and women who were the everyday makers of Sicilian history," and the fictional Mafia. (Bonanno knows from crime fiction: there are those who say that he's the real-life model for Michael Corleone, and he does not deny it.) <i>Bound by Honor</i> is as much a family saga as it is a true crime story, and Bonanno's insightful self-reflection guarantees a distinctive degree of honesty and depth.Bill Bonanno lives in Arizona.<br></p><h2>Ordinary Heroes: A Novel</h2><p><p>Stewart Dubinsky knew his father had served in World War II. And he'd been told how David Dubin (as his father had Americanized the name that Stewart later reclaimed) had rescued Stewart's mother from the horror of the Balingen concentration camp. But when he discovers, after his father's death, a packet of wartime letters to a former fianc�e, and learns of his father's court-martial and imprisonment, he is plunged into the mystery of his family's secret history and driven to uncover the truth about this enigmatic, distant man who'd always refused to talk about his war.</p><p>As he pieces together his father's past through military archives, letters, and, finally, notes from a memoir his father wrote while in prison, secretly preserved by the officer who defended him, Stewart starts to assemble a dramatic and baffling chain of events. He learns how Dubin, a JAG lawyer attached to Patton's Third Army and desperate for combat experience, got more than he bargained for when he was ordered to arrest Robert Martin, a wayward OSS officer who, despite his spectacular bravery with the French Resistance, appeared to be acting on orders other than his commanders'. In pursuit of Martin, Dubin and his sergeant are parachuted into Bastogne just as the Battle of the Bulge reaches its apex. Pressed into the leadership of a desperately depleted rifle company, the men are forced to abandon their quest for Martin and his fiery, maddeningly elusive comrade, Gita, as they fight for their lives through carnage and chaos the likes of which Dubin could never have imagined.</p><p>In reconstructing the terrible events and agonizing choices his father faced on the battlefield, in the courtroom, and in love, Stewart gains a closer understanding of his past, of his father's character, and of the brutal nature of war itself.</p></p><p><b>Scott Turow</b> is the author of worldwide bestselling novels including <i>Presumed Innocent</i>, <i>Innocent</i>, <i>The Burden of Proof</i>, <i>Reversible Errors</i> and <i>Limitations</i>.

STEWART: ALL PARENTS KEEP SECRETS</b><br><br><b>A</b>ll parents keep secrets from their children. My father, it seemed, kept more than most.<br><br>The first clue came when Dad passed away in February 2003 at the age of eighty-eight, after sailing into a Bermuda Triangle of illness--heart disease, lung cancer, and emphysema--all more or less attributable to sixty years of cigarettes. Characteristically, my mother refused to leave the burial details to my sister and me and met the funeral director with us. She chose a casket big enough to require a hood ornament, then pondered each word as the mortician read out the proposed death announcement.<br><br>"Was David a veteran?" he asked. The undertaker was the cleanest-looking man I'd ever seen, with lacquered nails, shaped eyebrows, and a face so smooth I suspected electrolysis.<br><br>"World War II," barked Sarah, who at the age of fifty-two still raced to answer before me.<br><br>The funeral director showed us the tiny black rendering of the Stars and Stripes that would appear in the paper beside Dad's name, but my mother was already agitating her thinning gray curls.<br><br>"No," she said. "No war. Not for this David Dubin." When she was upset, Mom's English tended to fail her. And my sister and I both knew enough to keep quiet when she was in those moods. The war, except for the bare details of how my father, an American officer, and my mother, an inmate in a German concentration camp, had fallen in love, virtually at first sight, had been an unpleasantness too great for discussion throughout our lives. But I had always assumed the silence was for her sake, not his.<br><br>By the end of the mourning visitation, Mom was ready to face sorting through Dad's belongings. Sarah announced she was too pressed to lend a hand and headed back to her accounting practice in Oakland, no doubt relishing the contrast with my unemployment. Mom assigned me to my father's closet on Monday morning, insisting that I consider taking much of his clothing. It was nearly all disastrously out of fashion, and only my mother could envision me, a longtime fatso, ever shrinking enough to squeeze into any of it. I selected a few ties to make her happy and began boxing the rest of his old shirts and suits for donation to the Haven, the Jewish relief agency my mother had helped found decades ago and which she almost single-handedly propelled for nearly twenty years as its Executive Director.<br><br>But I was unprepared for the emotion that overtook me. I knew my father as a remote, circumspect man, very orderly in almost everything, brilliant, studious, always civil. He preferred work to social engagements, although he had his own polite charm. Still, his great success came within the mighty fortress of the law. Elsewhere, he was less at ease. He let my mother hold sway at home, making the same weary joke for more than fifty years--he would never, he said, have enough skill as a lawyer to win an argument with Mom.<br><br>The Talmud says that a father should draw a son close with one hand and push him away with the other. Dad basically failed on both accounts. I felt a steady interest from him which I took for affection. Compared to many other dads, he was a champ, especially in a generation whose principal ideal of fathering was being a 'good provider.' But he was elusive at the core, almost as if he were wary of letting me know him too well. To the typical challenges I threw out as a kid, he generally responded by retreating, or turning me over to my mother. I have a perpetual memory of the times I was alone with him in the house as a child, infuriated by the silence. Did he know I was there? Or even goddamn care?<br><br>Now that Dad was gone, I was intensely aware of everything I'd never settled with him--in many cases, not even started on. Was he sorry I was not a lawyer like he was? What did he make of my daughters? Did he think the world was a good place or bad, and how could he explain the fact that the Trappers, for whom he maintained a resilient passion, had never won the World Series in his lifetime? Children and parents can't get it all sorted out. But it was painful to find that even in death he remained so enigmatic.<br><br>And so this business of touching the things my father touched, of smelling his Mennen talcum powder and Canoe aftershave, left me periodically swamped by feelings of absence and longing. Handling his personal effects was an intimacy I would never have dared if he were alive. I was in pain but deeply moved every minute and wept freely, burbling in the rear corner of the closet in hopes my mother wouldn't hear me. She herself was yet to shed a tear and undoubtedly thought that kind of iron stoicism was more appropriate to a man of fifty-six.<br><br>With the clothing packed, I began looking through the pillar of cardboard boxes I'd discovered in a dim corner. There was a remarkable collection of things there, many marked by a sentimentality I always thought Dad locked. He'd kept the schmaltzy valentines Sarah and I had made for him as grade-school art projects, and the Kindle County championship medal he'd won in high school in the backstroke. Dozens of packets of darkening Kodachromes reflected the life of his young family. In the bottom box, I found memorabilia of World War II, a sheaf of brittle papers, several red Nazi armbands taken, I imagined, as war trophies, and a curled stack of two-by-two snaps, good little black-and-white photos that must have been shot by someone else since my father was often the subject, looking thin and taciturn. Finally, I came upon a bundle of letters packed in an old candy tin to which a note was tied with a piece of green yarn dulled by time. It was written in a precise hand and dated May 14, 1945.<br><br><i>Dear David</i>,<br><i>I am returning to your family the letters you have sent while you have been overseas. I suppose they may have some significance to you in the future. Inasmuch as you are determined to no longer be a part of my life, I have to accept that once time passes and my hurt diminishes, they will not mean anything to me. I'm sure your father has let you know that I brought your ring back to him last month</i>.<br><i>For all of this, David, I can't make myself be angry at you for ending our engagement. When I saw your father, he said that you were now being court-martialed and actually face prison. I can hardly believe that about someone like you, but I would never have believed that you would desert me either. My father says men are known to go crazy during wartime. But I can't wait any longer for you to come back to your senses</i>.<br><i>When I cry at night, David--and I won't pretend for your sake that I don't--one thing bothers me the most. I spent so many hours praying to God for Him to deliver you safely; I begged Him to allow you to live, and if He was especially kind, to let you come back whole. Now that the fighting there is over, I cannot believe that my prayers were answered and that I was too foolish to ask that when you returned, you would be coming home to me</i>.<br><i>I wish you the best of luck in your present troubles</i>.<br><i>Grace</i><br>* * *<br><br>This letter knocked me flat. Court-martialed! The last thing I could imagine of my tirelessly proper father was being charged with a serious crime. And a heartbreaker as well. I had never heard a word about any of these events. But more even than surprise, across the arc of time, like light emitted by distant stars decades ago, I felt pierced by this woman's pain. Somehow her incomprehension alloyed itself with my own confusion and disappointment and frustrated love, and instantly inspired a ferocious curiosity to find out what had happened.<br><br>Dad's death had come while I was already gasping in one of life's waterfalls. Late the year before, after <br>reaching fifty-five, I had retired early from the Kindle County <i>Tribune</i>, my sole employer as an adult. It was time. I think I was regarded as an excellent reporter--I had the prizes on the wall to prove it--but nobody pretended, me least of all, that I had the focus or the way with people to become an editor. By then, I'd been on the courthouse beat for close to two decades. Given the eternal nature of human failings, I felt like a TV critic assigned to watch nothing but reruns. After thirty-three years at the <i>Trib</i>, my pension, combined with a generous buyout, was close to my salary, and my collegiate cynicism about capitalism had somehow fed an uncanny knack in the stock market. With our modest tastes, Nona and I wouldn't have to worry about money. While I still had the energy, I wanted to indulge every journalist's fantasy: I was going to write a book.<br><br>It did not work out. For one thing, I lacked a subject. Who the hell really cared about the decades-old murder trial of the Chief Deputy Prosecuting Attorney that I'd once thought was such a nifty topic? Instead, three times a day, I found myself staring across the table at Nona, my high-school sweetheart, where it swiftly became apparent that neither of us especially liked what we were seeing. I wish I could cite some melodrama like an affair or death threats to explain what had gone wrong. But the truth is that the handwriting had been on the wall so long, we'd just regarded it as part of the decorating. After thirty years, we had drifted into one of those marriages that never recovered its motive once our daughters were grown. Nine weeks before Dad's passing, Nona and I had separated. We had dinner once each week, where we discussed our business amiably, frustrated one another in the ways we always had, and exhibited no signs of longing or second thoughts. Our daughters were devastated, but I figured we both deserved some credit for having the guts to hope for better at this late date.<br><br>Nevertheless, I was already feeling battered before Dad died. By the time we buried him, I was half inclined to jump into the hole beside him. Sooner or later, I knew I'd pick myself up and go on. I'd been offered freelance gigs at two magazines, one local, one national. At five foot nine and 215 pounds, I am not exactly a catch, but the...</p><h2>Alive and Well with Pluto: Transits of Power and Renewal</h2><p>Now you can understand how Pluto in your astrological chart is not a curse, but a notification that the time is right for personal development, when you get <i>Alive and Well with Pluto</i> by Bil Tierney. <br> <br>If you are new to astrology, or even if you have been practicing for some time, you may have felt that a visit from Pluto as it transits your chart is like a curse from the universe.

How do you cope with not feeling God&#39;s presence and what do you do when He seems to have walked off the stage of your life? What is the main destroyer of Christian relationships that no one talks about and how can you avoid it? What&#39;s the truth behind spiritual gifts? How can you be set free from religious apathy on the one hand and performance-based legalism on the other? What are the three distinct ways that God speaks today and how can we recognize His voice when He speaks through them? What is Christian code language and Christianeze, and how can we rid ourselves of them? Why do so many mentors end up turning on their apprentices? What are the three spiritual conversational styles that Christians use which cause believers to assume they disagree with one another when they really don&#39;t? This book offers solutions to these problems and more. Encouraging, insightful, and inspiring. A short, powerful, and easy-to-read work on spiritual transformation.</p><p>Frank Viola has helped thousands of people around the world to deepen their relationship with Jesus Christ and enter into a more vibrant and authentic experience of church. His mission is to help serious followers of Jesus know their Lord more deeply so they can experience real transformation and make a lasting impact. Viola has written many books on these themes, including God&#39;s Favorite Place on Earth, From Eternity to Here, and Jesus Manifesto (with Leonard Sweet). His blog, frankviola.org, is rated as one of the most popular in Christian circles today."You're in for a compelling treat with <em>Revise Us Again</em>. In ten easy-to-read chapters, Frank Viola gently&#x2014;but directly&#x2014;invites us to revise our long-held 'scripted' assumptions about how God communicates to us, how Christians speak to one another, the work of the Holy Spirit in our midst today, and the content of the good news we proclaim to our friends and neighbors. The result is vintage Viola&#x2014;a sacred-cow barbecue with little aftertaste. Highly recommended!" Mike Morrel, journalist and futurist <p>"I loved this book. From the introduction to the concluding remarks, there was a spirit of grace that invited me to reexamine some of my own ideas about the Christian life. While <em>Revise Us Again</em> is an easy read, its message is profound! Please give yourself permission to ask some hard questions. I highly recommend Frank's new book." S. J. Hill, Bible teacher, speaker, and author of <em>Enjoying God</em></p> <p>"<em>Revise Us Again</em> is a very timely book. I have felt that the Christian community has needed such a work for quite some time now. Each chapter is full of skillfully written material that is spot on for this generation. We desperately need a major revision of our thinking and our speaking, and this book is right on target in placing the spotlight where it is needed: our unscriptural and unspiritual perceptions about Christ and His church. This work will greatly help in the process of religious 'detoxing' that needs to take place in western Christianity."

Augustine Shaw was a notable photo-journalist, happily married with two small children &#x2013; until he returned from a stint in Iraq missing a hand and suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Now he&#x2019;s lost his career, his peace of mind and his family. </p><p>Brady is hired to seem him through the divorce. The client wasn&#x2019;t eager to accept Brady&#x2019;s representation, but before the divorce proceedings are very far along, the photographer is found dead in his rented apartment, an apparent suicide.</p><p>But something isn&#x2019;t right and Brady starts to think the suicide was staged. With very little to go on and&nbsp;with everyone around him&nbsp;wanting to quickly close the books on&nbsp;what appears to be a tragic case, Brady soon finds himself alone, in the midst of one of the most dangerous situations of his entire life, and facing people who&nbsp;do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;to avoid being exposed.</p></p><p>William G. Tapply was the author of more than two dozen novels, many of them featuring his signature character, Brady Coyne.&nbsp;He was also the author of the critically acclaimed Stoney Calhoun novels, as well as several books on fishing and wildlife. The Writer in Residence at Clark University, Tapply lived with his wife, novelist Vicki Stiefel, in Hancock, New Hampshire.After two dozen adventures (<i>One-Way Ticket</i>, etc.), Tapply's Brady Coyne, a refreshingly decent lawyer, remains a pleasure to see at work. After a seven-year absence from Brady's life, Alexandria Shaw, a former lover, walks into his Boston office and asks him to handle her brother's divorce case. Gus Shaw, an independent photojournalist who lost his right hand in Iraq and is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, promises to be a difficult client, but soon after Brady and Gus talk, Gus is found dead, an apparent suicide. Though no evidence suggests murder, Alexandria is convinced her brother didn't kill himself; Brady agrees to probe, with predictable results. While Brady tends to telegraph important aspects of the case, his investigation reveals a lot of the hidden collateral damage of the Iraq war: bereaved families, physically or psychologically wounded vets and the people who try to help those who have suffered. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Science thereby presents a picture of scientific exploration and discovery that takes observation and method as well as imagination and sheer chance into account. By evaluating the discoveries that have changed life over the past 2,500 years, each two-page biography that makes up <i>Science</i> succeeds in assessing how and why each of the one hundred lives presented led to significant changes in our world.<br></p><p>Ever wondered who was behind some of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of all time but been too intimidated by the overwhelming volume of literature on the subject to know where to begin? Or perhaps been interested in finding out a little more about science but have been put off by pages and pages of dry text aimed only at academics? <p>'Science: 100 Scientists Who Changed The World' is above all a science book which aims to be accessible. My intention in writing this text has been to provide concise, jargon-free insights into the lives and learnings of some of the greatest people who ever lived. Beginning with Anaximander some two and a half thousand years ago and continuing up to the present day, 'Science' is a history of science through the people who discovered it. With each entry an illustrated double page spread, the book can be read in "bite-sized" chunks in random order or chronologically from start to finish. </p><p>I have tried to offer enough detail on each scientist to be engaging without offering so much as to be off-putting. Consequently, &#x2018;Science&#x2019; should appeal to adults, students and children from their early teens onwards keen to understand the impact those included have had on the development of the world, and continue to exert today. </p><p>I hope you enjoy it. </p><p>Best wishes, Jon Balchin</p><b>Jon Balchin</b> graduated from the University of London with honors in 1997.

He was a mentor to such prominent theologians as Hans Urs von Balthasar and Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) and in this book, Guardini's teaching style comes truly alive. Delivered while writing his bestselling masterwork <i>The Lord</i>, these reflections inspire the reader to contemplate the presence that Jesus Christ manifested to the world. Guardini masterfully carries the reader beyond the stories and events of scripture to focus on the person of Jesus Christ. These meditations are accessible and clear, but maintain the theological depth found in Guardini's seminal work.</p><p><b>Romano Guardini (1885-1968)</b> is regarded as one of the most important Catholic intellectuals of the twentieth century. Guardini's prolific status as a scholar and teacher heavily influenced the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and his intellectual disciples include Pope Benedict XVI."We tend to stand at a distance when encountering a mystery. In <i>Jesus Christus</i>, Romano Guardini invites us to enter into the mystery of Christ and experience the mysteries of God that are forever challenging us." --<b>Rev. Eugene F. Hemrick</b>, Director, National Institute for the Renewal of the Priesthood<br>"One of Guardini's favorite expressions was, 'that which is truly real will arise from the rich, varied expansiveness of our existence, of our being fully Christian, and will lead us to the One who is truly real.' As we are taught by Guardini, the essence of Christianity is not an idea, not a system of thought, not a plan of action. The essence of Christianity is a Person: Jesus Christ himself. That which is essential is the One who is essential. To become truly real means to come to know Jesus Christ and to learn from him what it means to be human." --<b>Pope Benedict XVI</b><br>"The explicit goal of Guardini's meditations in <i>Jesus Christus</i> is to lead each reader to a greater knowledge of and union with the Lord. At the same time, the book's implicit goal is each reader's maturation into the person whom God envisions." --<b>Robert Krieg</b>, Professor of Theology, University of Notre Dame</p><h2>Frog in the Kitchen Sink (Eyeball Animation): Board Book Edition</h2><p>When he's not soaking in Mom's sink suds, you might find this precocious little hopper slipping and sliding in Brother's shorts.

She also kept detailed diaries, which sweep us into fashionable balls and local gossip...magical scenes of winter in Russia...and devastating famine in the countryside. Sophia's works deepen our understanding of the era as well as of this amazing woman, who had thirteen children, battled a troubled marriage, and, though blessed with a creative life of her own, was so devoted to her husband's career that she hand-copied his great works <i>Anna Karenina</i> and <i>War and Peace</i> many times over. <br><br><i>Song Without Words</i> showcases the photographs by theme, with Sophia's writings providing emotional context for many of the images. Commentary by author Leah Bendavid-Val weaves through the book, linking diaries with pictures and placing each in its historical and literary setting. <br><br>Autobiographical in nature, yet global in its true scope, <i>Song Without Words</i> brings to light the gifts of a major figure whose previously unknown works enrich our knowledge of literature, photography, and history.</p><p>Leah Bendavid-Val, Director of Photography Publishing for National Geographic Books, is the author of <i>Propaganda &amp; Dreams: Photographing the 1930s in the USSR and the US; Changing Reality: Recent Soviet Photography; National Geographic: The Photographs;</i> and <i>Stories on Paper &amp; Glass.</i> She has curated photography exhibitions for museums worldwide.</p><h2>Klondike Gold</h2><p>Set in 1896 at the time of the Yukon gold rush, a fictional tale follows the adventures of young Bill Howell who left all the comforts of his normal life to pursue a dream of striking it rich and, after a difficult ocean journey, perilous hikes through snowy mountains, and troubles in dangerous towns, finally stakes his claim and begins the process of looking for his elusive treasure.</p><p><b>Alice Provensen</b> collaborated with her late husband, Martin, on numerous highly acclaimed picture books, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>The Glorious Flight</i> and Nancy Willard's Newbery Medal-winning <i>A Visit to William Blake's Inn,</i> which was also a Caldecott Honor Book.

He and a friend cross the country, outfit themselves in Seattle, and continue the trek north on water, over mountains, and through seasons to the Klondike River. Each spread is divided horizontally into thirds; a band of the text is sandwiched between the primary scenes on the top and a lower border of related information and images. The Caldecott-award winner's oils are reminiscent of, but more rugged than, her illustrations with her late husband Martin for Nancy Willard's <i>A Visit to William Blake's Inn</i> (Harcourt, 1981). The cities are populated with teeming crowds and puffing factories in contrast to the lonely camps in the stark wilderness, although the beauty of those outposts is revealed as in the scene displaying the Northern Lights. Readers will be fascinated by the one-year supply list (800 lbs of flour, 200 lbs of beans) and the stairs of ice carved in the steep slopes; saddened by the animals that had to be abandoned on the arduous ascent; and intrigued by the travelers' ingenuity. The prospectors' drive&#x2013;and disappointment (when half of the fortune sinks in a thawing river on the return home)--is palpable. This first-rate adventure mingles suspense, history, and detailed depictions of mining in a story that is sure to be a hit in the classroom and under the covers.<i>&#x2013;Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And if neoconservatism can be said to have a father or an architect, that person is Irving Kristol.<br>Neoconservatism is the most comprehensive selection of Kristol's influential writings on politics and economics, as well as the best of his now-famous essays on society, religion, culture, literature, education, and - above all - the "values" issues that have come to define the neo-conservative critique of contemporary life.<br>These essays provide an unparalleled insight into the 50-year development of Kristol's social and political ideas, from an uneasy socialism tempered with religious orthodoxy, to a vigilant optimism about the future of the American experiment. Those already familiar with Kristol's work will especially enjoy the new autobiographical essay that introduces this volume; it is sprinkled with personal recollections about such luminaries as Lionel Trilling, Leo Strauss, Saul Bellow, Sidney Hook, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and historian Gertrude Himmelfarb (who is also Mrs. Kristol). Those relatively new to Kristol's writings will be treated to some of the most lucid, insightful, entertaining, and intellectually challenging essays of our time.</p><p>This fascinating book by one of America's leading public intellectuals spans nearly half a century of writing, with essays on sex, politics, and religion. Irving Kristol has long been considered the godfather of neoconservatism, a political persuasion that breathed intellectual life into the moribund Republican Party during the 1970s and helped make Ronald Reagan's ascendancy possible. But because Kristol spent the bulk of his career in the highbrow journalistic world of essays and commentary, he never authored a full book that defines his mode of thinking or traces its development. This collection of essays is the closest thing there is, and it's a real treat: smart, often counterintuitive, and full of good writing. As Kristol notes on the opening pages, "An intellectual who didn't write struck me as only half an intellectual." And Kristol is clearly a full intellectual. Much of the writing here has appeared elsewhere--in <i>Commentary</i>, where Kristol served as an editor; <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, where he regularly contributes to the op-ed page; and <i>The Public Interest</i>, which he founded and still edits. The best part of the book, however, is an original essay, "An Autobiographical Memoir." In it, Kristol sketches his intellectual growth, which began while he was a young man attending neo-Trotskyite meetings in Brooklyn (where he met his wife, the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb) and eventually took him to Washington, D.C., where today he is a fixture at right-of-center political gatherings. For readers interested in conservative politics, <i>Neoconservatism</i> is a keeper. <i>--John J.

But he'd gotten up early this morning, needing a run after his long flight yesterday. He'd needed to clear his head, and when he'd ended up at one of the two arenas that would serve as home for several of the ice events here at the international games, he couldn't help himself. He had to see if he could get inside. Fortunately, the team's coach had been arriving and spotted him, and he had access, so he let Will inside.<br><br> But only for a few minutes, coach had said.<br><br> A few minutes was all he needed.<br><br> The arena was huge, and there'd be attendees from all over the world watching the games. On the ice, there'd be hockey, as well as figure skating, curling and speed skating. He took in the sheer size of the arena, then dragged in a deep breath of chilled air. There was something about the smell of a rink, that crisp scent of icy air that clung to his lungs and gave him life. It replenished him, gave him a sense of purpose and affirmed he was right where he was supposed to be.<br><br> Like now, looking over the ice rink for what would soon be the international games in Vancouver. He felt damned fortunate to be here and he couldn't wait for the games to start. He was itching to put on his skates and get out there, test the ice and get some speed going under his skates. Then all he'd need was his stick and a puck to chase after.<br><br> He loved playing hockey. It fulfilled him in ways he would have never thought possible when he had been a kid fighting it out with his friends at the local rink back in Chicago. Back then it had been all fun and games, shoving and laughing and playing all day.<br><br> Even then, it had been in his blood. Now, it was his job playing forward for the St. Louis Ice hockey team.<br><br> And to be selected to play for these games, not just once, but twice? It was a damn dream come true. He planned to soak in every minute of this experience, so he could remember it forever.<br><br> Four years ago he'd been twenty-three, an excited young guy who'd partied his ass off the entire time. If he'd been honest with himself, he couldn't remember much about the experience. On the ice, of course, he'd put everything into his game play. Off the ice had been a constant party. This time he wanted to soak in the experience, really live it. This time would be different.<br><br> He could already imagine playing in the upcoming games, even against some of his own teammates, who'd be playing for their home countries. They'd talked about it before the games began. On their pro team, they fought for the Ice. Here, they'd play for their country and they'd respect each other for that.<br><br> When it was over, they'd all be teammates again.<br><br> "That's it, Mad Dog," Coach Stein said as he came up to him. "Time to clear out."<br><br> Will nodded. "Thanks for getting me in."<br><br> "We'll see you back here tomorrow after the rest of your teammates arrive."<br><br> "You got it."<br><br> "Try to stay out of trouble until then."<br><br> Will laughed. "You know I will."<br><br> Coach Stein gave him a head tilt and a disbelieving look. "Do I?"<br><br> Will gave him a grin. Okay, so he had a rep. Even Coach Stein, who was the coach of the New York team, knew his reputation. He went out the way he came in, through the front doors that were locked and guarded by a security guy, who nodded and let him out.<br><br> He stretched, started off with a walk, then eased into a run as he made his way back to the village he'd call his home for the next three weeks. His roommate hadn't arrived yet, so he had no idea who he'd be bunking with. Hopefully someone fun.<br><br> They weren't allowed to bunk with teammates. He was certain it was the committee's way of getting them to branch out and make friends with people from other disciplines, and often other countries. Last time he'd bunked with a bobsledder from Latvia.<br><br> They'd partied their asses off the entire time. He'd had a blast. He was looking forward to reconnecting with several of the friends he'd made during the games four years ago.<br><br> When he got back to his apartment in the village, he stripped and climbed into the shower. A hot shower was one of his favorite things. Maybe even top-ten favorite things, especially after a grueling hockey game.<br><br> Thanks to his run he was hungry, so he got dressed and headed out to the other building where the dining hall was located.<br><br> It was fully stocked-and huge. It was like a hangout here, and the size of a couple of football fields.<br><br> You could get anything you wanted, with food from almost every country participating. Last time he was here he'd made sure to eat something from every country. It seemed only respectful to sample the various cuisines.<br><br> And, hey, he liked to eat.<br><br> He planned to do it again.<br><br> Many athletes had already arrived, though the dining hall wouldn't be fully packed until the end of the week. Several of his teammates were flying in today, so he'd catch up with them later. For now, and since he wasn't shy, he sat with some of the snowboarders, figure skaters and downhill skiers.<br><br> The great thing about the games was that everyone was friendly. You could take a seat and strike up a conversation with anyone.<br><br> "How was your flight?" a guy named Hans asked him.<br><br> "Long. Yours?"<br><br> Hans smiled. "Same. Slept in a bit this morning. Looking forward to getting my skis on those mountains, though."<br><br> Will dug his fork into the egg-white omelet and nodded. "I got a glimpse at the hockey arena earlier, but they wouldn't let me skate on it yet."<br><br> Telisa, one of the figure skaters, looked shocked. "They let you in already?"<br><br> "My coach was there so he snuck me in. But I couldn't get on the ice."<br><br> "Oh. You're lucky." Robbie was Telisa's husband and the other half of their pairs team. "We're nearly drooling over the figure skating arena. We can't wait to get in there."<br><br> "They said they'd open it up to us this afternoon," said Rory, one of the individual figure skaters. "We have to practice and stay limber."<br><br> "Huh," Will said. "Maybe I'll mention that to my coach. Can't get stiff."<br><br> "Unless it's your dick," Zeb, one of the skiers, said. "You want that to be stiff at all times."<br><br> Will laughed, then noticed he'd gotten a suggestive look from one of the women across the table. He thought her name might be Monie or Monica or something. No idea. The names had flown fast and furious when he'd sat down.<br><br> He wasn't interested in sex. Okay, that was a lie. He was always interested in sex. But there was plenty of time for that, and for the next few weeks there'd be a hell of a lot of it going around.<br><br> The only thing on his mind right now was getting on the ice. After that he could think about sex.<br>Amber Sloane set her bags down at the front counter, taking in the multitudes of athletes surrounding her.<br><br> She was here. In Vancouver. Her third-and final-international games.<br><br> This was her last shot at gold. At twenty-four, she'd be considered old for a figure skater. Her biggest competition was here. She spied Tia Chang in line about four people ahead of her, her posture near perfect even standing in line, her dark hair shining like a fall of midnight down her back as she absent-mindedly checked her phone. It was like she had no cares at all.<br><br> Seventeen. God, that had been a lifetime ago for Amber. At seventeen she'd been a nervous wreck at the Worlds. But she'd come in first.<br><br> It was only the international games where she'd failed to grab the gold. She'd won both bronze and silver, but the gold eluded her.<br><br> This was her last chance. Her mother told her it was her time to shine.<br><br> Amber thought her chance escaped her four years ago, when Elena Bulosova of Russia had just inched her out for that gold medal.<br><br> Amber's long program had been better. The judges had to have been blind not to see it.<br><br> But this was her year. She'd revamped her entire program and worked her ass off the past four years. And now, she was ready to put it all out there and win.<br><br> Or she'd be done. Because there'd be no more games for her after this year.<br><br> "Amber!"<br><br> She heard the shout of her name and turned, then smiled when she saw her friend, Lisa Peterson.<br><br> Lisa threw her arms around Amber.<br><br> "I've missed you," Lisa said.<br><br> "I've missed you, too, Lisa. How excited are you to have the games in your home city?"<br><br> "Excited beyond belief." Lisa pulled back, then looked around and whispered, "So, guess what?"<br><br> "What?"<br><br> "I pulled some strings, and don't ask me how I pulled those strings, but you and I are going to be roommates again."<br><br> Amber raised a brow. "Seriously?"<br><br> "Yes." Lisa grinned.<br><br> Amber couldn't be more excited to have Lisa as her roommate again. Lisa was outgoing and talkative and incredibly sweet. "That is fabulous. I'm so excited. Though you aren't going to boot me out of the room at two in the morning again because you've brought some hot guy in to bone, are you?"<br><br> Lisa crossed her fingers over her heart. "I promise I won't do that. We'll boot as-yet-unselected-hottie's roommate out."<br><br> Amber laughed. "Perfect."<br><br> They waited in line together and discussed their careers.<br><br> "How's snowboarding?"<br><br> "Kicking it," Lisa said. "And if you'd come to Vancouver like I keep asking you, I'd teach you how to snowboard."<br><br> Amber felt very guilty about that. For the past four years, Lisa had invited her several times to many events, and to her home for a visit.<br><br> "I know. I'm sorry. After winning the silver four years ago, I've done nothing but work on a new routine."<br><br> They made their way to the front desk and checked in, got their credentials and packets, then grabbed their luggage.<br><br> "There's more to life than just your work as a figure skater, Amber," Lisa said, taking out the map that would lead them to their building. "You have to find time for fun. For a life."<br><br> "I know. After this year, I'm going to travel and have nothing but fun."<br><br> "That's what you said four years ago."<br><br> They walked outside and Amber pulled her sunglasses off her head and slid them over her eyes.<br><br> "This year is different. I'm confident about my routine, and I know this is my last time at the games, win or lose, so I intend to enjoy it."<br><br> Lisa stopped and turned to her. "Which means you plan to have some fun?"<br><br> Amber offered up a tenuous smile. Did she even know how to have fun? "Sure."<br><br> "Excellent. We'll start tonight after we unpack."<br><br> She felt a giant lump of trepidation. What was she thinking telling Lisa she was out for a good time? Her mother's voice rang in her head.<br><br> <i>The work is everything, Amber. Focus, keep your head down and skate. No distractions.</i><br><br> No distractions. Fun was a distraction. That had been drilled into her head from the time she was six years old and had first strapped on a pair of ice skates. Since then it had been all work.<br><br> And the reward would come when she won the gold. She knew that.<br><br> But still, her mother wasn't allowed in the village, and what she didn't know, she didn't know.<br><br> They opened the door to their apartment. It was spacious and lovely, with cream-colored d&#x17d;cor, a living room, kitchen and two queen beds in the large bedroom.<br><br> "This is awesome," Lisa said. "And the living room has a fold-out sofa. You can even stay here if I have a guy over."<br><br> Amber laughed. "Good to know."<br><br> "Seriously. And who knows? You might even be busy with some stud of your own and I'll be bunking on the couch."<br><br> Highly unlikely, but she wasn't going to spoil Lisa's grand plans.<br><br> "Come on, let's unpack and go check out who's here."<br><br> "Okay." She carried her luggage into the bedroom and set it down.<br><br> This time would be different. She was determined. And she was so happy Lisa was her roommate again. If anyone knew how to have a good time, it was Lisa.<br><br> Amber had worked her ass off the past four years. She intended to show that on the ice. She was disciplined and ready.<br><br> But when she wasn't performing, she intended to party. Or, at least, learn how to party.<br><br> She had to start somewhere. She was twenty-four years old and it was time to start living.</p><h2>365 Science Activities IR</h2><p>An Experiment book by Usborne Books There&#39;s a new scientific discovery to be made each day of the year in this inspiring book full of easy and exciting experiments.

In &#34;Encounters with God Sister&#34;, Wendy Beckett traveled to remote churches and monasteries to view the earliest icons of Mary. In &#34;Real Presence&#34;, she resumes this journey to see additional early icons of Jesus and the saints - icons that are among the few to survive the wholesale destruction of icons in the early eighth century. In contrast with the familiar and magnificent icons of later history, these early icons have a haunting simplicity and unfamiliar spiritual power. They come to us from a time closer to that of Christ, when faith was still alive with wonder and possibilities, and these images, a vehicle for prayer, can truly convey his real presence. Sister Wendy journeys to the heart of the great treasure-house of pre-Iconoclastic icons at Mt. Sinai to celebrate its unique historical and spiritual value, and to reveal the spirituality and devotional practices of our ancestors. Prayerful and heartfelt, &#34;Real Presence&#34; offers everyone &#39;a taste of the spiritual happiness that is there for the asking, for the seeking, for attention&#39;.</p><p>Sister Wendy became a nun at the age of 16, went on to live for nearly 20 years as a hermit, and then was exposed to the world in a successful television career as the &#39;art nun&#39;.

This is a great read for any golfer, no matter what their handicap.</p></p><p>Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, the #1 New York Times and USA Today bestselling authors, are joined by Jeff Aubery, Chrissy Donnelly and Mark Donnelly.<b>Maybe I Need a Crystal Ball</b><br><br> <p> Until I started playing golf, I thought that wine tasting had to be the most confusing thing I'd ever done. People with names like Higgins rambling on about residual sugar and tannin, describing each quarter-ounce sample in terms like "full-bodied, yet unpretentious." And I could never remember whether I was supposed to age it, chill it or drink it with fresh fish during a full moon. Just when I thought I was a genius for knowing the difference between a cabernet and cabaret, I went to the pro shop for golf balls.</p> <p>"What kind?" the pro asked.</p> <p> "I dunno, white, I guess.�</p> <p> He rubbed his hands together as he scanned the tri-level ball display. "Do you want a two-piece ball?" I though this was a joke, of course. "No," I said. "I like to start off with them whole. They'll break when I wallop them with my driver.�</p> <p> "Oh," he said without as much as a smile. "A big hitter. Then you want distance.�</p> <p> He handed me a shiny box with gold lettering. The price tag on the end was more than I'd paid for dinner for my wife and I the previous evening.</p> <p>"These have computer-generated dimple patterns and use a complex two-piece injection molding system. They offer blistering distance.�</p> <p> "Perfect," I said. "Course I'll probably overshoot the green now on any hole less than four hundred yards.�</p> <p> He still didn't laugh. He just removed the box of balls from my hand and said, "Aahhh ... stopping power.�</p><p> </p><p> He slid another brightly colored box across the counter, looked me in the eye and said, "Lithium Surlyn.�</p> <p> I offered my hand. "Emie Witham," I said.</p> <p> "No," he said. "The cover. It's made of Lithium Surlyn. You know what that means."</p> <p> "It's radioactive?"</p> <p> "It's soft. And it's been reformulated for more feel. Plus the aerodynamics have been modified for lower trajectory.... Did you want lower trajectory?" </p> <p>"Well, sure. I guess. If that means it'll go straighter.�</p> "Oh, oh. Accuracy problem, huh? Slice? Hook?"<p></p> <p> "Yes. Yes.�</p> <p> He walked down to the end of the ball display and came back with yet another package.</p> <p> "These offer less sidespin. Plus they're 2 percent larger than a regular ball."</p> <p> "Wow. Two percent. Guess I'11 need a bigger bag." I looked at my watch. "Oh, oh. Tee-time.�</p> <p> He apparently didn't hear me. He grabbed more boxes from the shelf. "How about a balata ball? This one spins at more than eleven thousand RPMs and maintains consistent compressions. This other balata carries 266 yards and is an evolutionary achievement in balata ball performance.�</p> <p> "I�aahhh��</p> <p> "Don't want a balata? This brand precisely blends five different dimple depths for raw length and pinpoint control. Or one designed for swing speeds in excess of ninety-five miles per hour."</p> <p> "I�aahhh�"</p> <p> "And here we have one that rockets off the club face, with an earlier peak and shallow descent.... This one penetrates the wind.... This one rolls longer.... This one has Trilyn....This one has Zylin....This one ..."</p> <p> "I�aahhh ... I think I'11 just take a few of these." I picked two yellow balls and one orange one from the used ball jar and threw a five-dollar bill on the counter. I felt bad, but my foursome had already finished the first hole.</p> <p> He sighed, took a deep breath and started putting all the bright shiny boxes away. Then the little bell above the door jingled.</p> <p> "I need some golf balls," the young woman said. "But I'm not sure what kind. Do you have any suggestions?"</p> <p> "Do you want a two-piece ball?" I heard him ask, as I ran for the second tee.</p> �<i>Ernie Witham<br><br><br> <p>(c)1999. All rights reserved.

The Vietnam War was raging. President Lyndon Johnson, facing a challenge in his own Democratic Party from the maverick antiwar candidate Eugene McCarthy, announced that he would not seek a second term. In April, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and riots broke out in inner cities throughout America. Bobby Kennedy was killed after winning the California primary in June. In August, Republicans met in Miami, picking the little-loved Richard Nixon as their candidate, while in September, Democrats in Chicago backed the ineffectual vice president, Hubert Humphrey. TVs across the country showed antiwar protesters filling the streets of Chicago and the police running amok, beating and arresting demonstrators and delegates alike.<br> In <i>Miami and the Siege of Chicago</i>, Norman Mailer, America&#x2019;s most protean and provocative writer, brings a novelist&#x2019;s eye to bear on the events of 1968, a decisive year in modern American politics, from which today&#x2019;s bitterly divided country arose.</p><p><b>Norman Mailer</b> (1923-2007) was the author of more than thirty books, including <i>The Naked and the Dead;</i> <i>The Armies of the Night</i>, for which he won a National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize; <i>The Executioner&#x2019;s Song</i>, for which he won his second Pulitzer Prize; and<i> The Castle in the Forest</i>.<br><br><b>Frank Rich </b>is a columnist for The New York Times. His latest book is <i>The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth from 9/11 to Katrina. </i>"Mailer was a poet laureate of the punch, and this classic New Journalism--style report on the '68 conventions sizes up presidential wanna-bes as if they were a batch of second-rate palookas... His descriptions alone are reason to read this still-relevant book." --<i>Time Out New York</i><br><br>"Don't skim...if you dash your way through 'Miami and the Siege of Chicago,' Mailer's masterful account of the upheaval that occurred 40 years ago when Republicans and Democrats met in those two cities, there to select their presidential nominees, you'll miss a lot. First published in 1968, and reissued earlier this month by New York Review Books, Mailer's report glows with descriptions of the people and the places whose permanent identities were forged in the hot furnace of that tragic, fateful year. To understand 1968, you must read Mailer..." --<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"Our Democratic primaries are run the way they are now mainly because of the way they were run then...The almost-closing line of the book is the prediction that Mailer wishes he had made to Eugene McCarthy&#x2019;s daughter: 'Dear Miss, we will be fighting for forty years.' He got that right, among many other things." --Christopher Hitchens, <i>The Atlantic</i><br><br>"The nostalgic or the curious can seek out Norman Mailer's <i>Miami and the Siege of Chicago...</i>which analyzed events inside and beyond the convention hall with its author's characteristic, and in this case perfectly appropriate, blend of intellectual grandiosity and journalistic acumen." --A. O. Scott, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>One "of the era's definitional books." --<i>The Nation</i><br><br>"Wrong as often as he was right, Mailer seems so brave precisely because he was so ready to risk looking foolish. In <i>Miami and the Siege of Chicago, </i>which he wrote on assignment for <i>Harper's</i>, Mailer was not only perfectly attuned to the moment but prescient." --<i>The Boston Phoenix</i><br><br>"Dazzling accounts of the Republican and Democratic party conventions of 1968..."--<i>Newsday</i><br><br>"For historians who wish for the presence of a world-class literary witness at crucial<br>moments in history, Mailer in Miami and Chicago was heaven-sent." -<i>The Washington</i><br><i>Post</i><br><br>"This is an excellent account of the conventions...Mailer sets the scene sensually like Dickens...his vignettes have imperial authority." -<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>A "triumphantly vivid work of journalism." -<i>Book World</i><br><br>"A political classic" -<i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"This is Mailer's classic account of the Democratic and Republican conventions of<br>1968. It is an insightful portrayal of the politicians and the turbulent time." -United Press International<br><br>"A tense balance between social and literary observation which often reads like a good, old-fashioned novel in which suspense, character, plot revelations, and pungently describable action abound...The peculiar power of these books comes not from the fact that Mailer offers us better writing than that to which we are generally accustomed in politics, but, rather, from the uncanny way in which he has managed to maintain in these works the stylistic play and form of the most complex literary fiction." -<i>The New York Review of Books </i>(reviewed with <i>The Armies of the Night)</i></p><h2>Congo: The Epic History of a People</h2><p><p>Hailed as "a monumental history . . . more exciting than any novel" (NRC Handelsblad), David van Reybrouck's rich and gripping epic, in the tradition of Robert Hughes' <em>The Fatal Shore</em>, tells the extraordinary story of one of the world's most devastated countries: the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p> Epic in scope yet eminently readable, penetrating and deeply moving, David van Reybrouck's <em>Congo: The Epic History of a People</em> traces the fate of one of the world's most critical, failed nation-states, second only to war-torn Somalia: the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>Van Reybrouck takes us through several hundred years of history, bringing some of the most dramatic episodes in Congolese history. Here are the people and events that have impinged the Congo's development--from the slave trade to the ivory and rubber booms; from the arrival of Henry Morton Stanley to the tragic regime of King Leopold II; from global indignation to Belgian colonialism; from the struggle for independence to Mobutu's brutal rule; and from the world famous Rumble in the Jungle to the civil war over natural resources that began in 1996 and still rages today.</p><p>Van Reybrouck interweaves his own family's history with the voices of a diverse range of individuals--charismatic dictators, feuding warlords, child-soldiers, the elderly, female merchant smugglers, and many in the African diaspora of Europe and China--to offer a deeply humane approach to political history, focusing squarely on the Congolese perspective and returning a nation's history to its people.</p></p><p>"An unbelievable tour de force."--Humo<br><br>"Breathtaking."--Trouw<br><br>"If you are looking to read one book on Congo this year, this is it.

[..] As an eye, a judge, and a witness, a talented writer testifies."--V.Y.M. Mudimbe, author of The Invention of Africa<br><br>"Congo is a remarkable piece of work. Van Reybrouck [keeps] a panoramic history of a vast and complex nation accessible, intimate and particular."--Michela Wrong, author of In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz<br><br>"Van Reybrouck's extensive account reveals the depth and breadth of exploitation, particularly under Belgian colonial rule, and how Congo's story is one fraught with the toxic cycle of 'desire, frustration, revenge.'"--Publishers Weekly<br><br>"A vivid panorama of one of the most tormented lands in the world... A valuable addition to the rich literature that Congo has inspired."--Washington Post<br><br>"[A] detailed and well-researched biography, thoroughly rooted in the lived experience of the Congolese... It is clear that the author is not your typical historian dryly publishing his findings, but a literary artist with a pen almost as sharp as Lumumba's tongue."--ThinkAfricaPress.com<p>The gripping saga of one of the world's most devastated countries</p><p>The Democratic Republic of Congo currently ranks among the world's most failed nation-states, second only to war-torn Somalia. David Van Reybrouck's <em>Congo: The Epic History</em> of a People traces the history of this devastated nation from the beginnings of the slave trade through the arrival of Sir Henry Morton Stanley, the ivory and rubber booms, colonization, the struggle for independence, and the three decades of Mobutu's brutal rule. Van Reybrouck also examines the civil war--the world's deadliest conflict since the Second World War. Still raging today after seventeen years, the Congolese war is driven, in part, by the demand for the rare-earth minerals required to make cell phones.</p><p>Van Reybrouck has balanced hundreds of interviews with meticulous historical research to construct a many-dimensional portrait of the rich and convoluted history of Congo. Taking pains to seek out the Congolese perspective on the country's history, Van Reybrouck creates a panoramic canvas wherein the child soldiers whom he encounters in the eastern rebel territories talk candidly about their choices and misfortunes, and where elderly Congolese--some of them more than one hundred years old--reminisce about their lives in a country where the average life expectancy has dropped to forty-five.</p><p>Vast in scope yet eminently readable, both penetrating and deeply moving, <em>Congo</em> does for Africa what Robert Hughes's masterful and novelistic <em>The Fatal Shore</em> did for Australia. Van Reybrouck takes a deeply humane approach to political history, focusing squarely on the Congolese perspective and returning a nation's history to its people. Published to rave reviews in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2010, Congo has now been gracefully translated by the exceptional Sam Garrett, most recently the translator of Herman Koch's bestselling <em>The Dinner</em>.</p></p><h2>Kaplan Modern Real Estate Practice, 20th Edition (Paperback) &#x2013; Comprehensive Real Estate Guide on Law, Regulations, and Principles</h2><p><p>Kaplan's Modern Real Estate Practice has trained more than 3 million professionals since 1959.&nbsp;</p><p>Updated to reflect current legislation and market information, and to include the newest forms and web resources, this text and its ancillary products will provide you with the best foundation possible to launch your real estate career. &nbsp;<br><br>Each unit includes an overview of contents that highlights the topic and explains how it relates real estate law, regulations, and principles to the practice of real estate. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Additionally, the included QBank gives you the ability to create customized tests from hundreds of questions.</strong></p></p><p></p><h2>The Dragon on the Border</h2><p>Sir James, the Dragon Knight, faces his most terrifying challenge in the nearly indestructible Hollow Men, spirits of the dead who reside in empty suits of armor.

He studied politics and philosophy at Oxford University before moving to America in the early 1990s. Living first in Harlem, New York, he found employment as a construction worker, barman, and bookstore clerk. In 2000 he moved to Denver, Colorado, to become a high school English teacher and it was there that he began writing fiction. His first full-length novel, <i>Dead I Well May Be</i>, was shortlisted for the 2004 Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award and its sequel, <i>The Dead Yard</i>, was selected as one of the twelve best novels of the year by Publishers Weekly and won the 2007 Audie� Award for Best Thriller/Suspense. In 2008, his debut young adult novel, <i>The Lighthouse Land</i>, was shortlisted for the 2008 Young Hoosier Award and the 2008 Beehive Award. The final novel in the Dead trilogy, <i>The Bloomsday Dead</i>, was longlisted for the 2009 World Book Day Award. In 2009 he moved to Melbourne, Australia, with his wife and two children.<p><b>Chapter One: White Boy in Harlem</b> </p><p> I open my eyes. The train tracks. The river. A wall of heat. Unbearable white sunlight smacking off the railings, the street and the god-awfulness of the buildings. Steam from the permanent Con Ed hole at the corner. Gum and graffiti tags on the sidewalk. People on the platform -- Jesus Christ, are they really in sweaters and wool hats? Garbage everywhere: newspaper, bits of food, clothes, soda cans, beer cans. The traffic slow and angry. Diesel fumes from tubercular bus engines. Heat and poison from the exhausts on massive, bruised gypsy cabs. </p><p> I'm smoking. I'm standing here on the elevated subway platform looking down at all this enormous nightmare and I'm smoking. My skin can barely breathe. I'm panting. The back of my T-shirt is thick with sweat. 100 degrees, 90 percent relative humidity. I'm complaining about the pollution you can see in the sky above New Jersey and I'm smoking Camels. What an idiot. </p><p> Details. Dominican guys on the west side of Broadway. Black guys on the east. The Dominicans are in long cotton pants, sneakers, string T-shirts, gold chains. The black guys are in neat blue or yellow or red T-shirts with baggy denim shorts and better sneakers. The black guys are more comfortable, it's their turf for now, the Dominicans are newcomers. It's like <i>West Side</i> bloody <i>Story.</i> </p><p> In the deep pocket of my baggy shorts I start playing absently with the safety on my pistol. A very stupid thing to do. I stop myself. Besides, these guys aren't the enemy. No, the enemy, like the Lord, is subtle, and in our own image. </p><p> Some kids playing basketball without a hoop. Women shopping; heavy bags weighing them down, the older women pushing carts, the younger wearing hardly anything at all. Beautiful girls with long dark legs and dreamy voices that are here the only sounds of heaven. </p><p> Harlem has changed, of course. I mean, I'm not talking about the 125th Street of today or even of five years ago. There's a Starbucks there now. Multiplexes. HMV. An ex-president. This is before Giuliani saved the city. Twice. This is 1992. There are well over two thousand murders a year in New York. Gang wars. Crack killings. <i>The New York Times</i> publishes a murder map of Manhattan with a dot for every violent death. Once you get above Central Park the dots get thicker and east and north of Columbia University it becomes one big smudge. A killing took place yesterday at this very corner. A boy on a bicycle shot a woman in the chest when she didn't give up her pocketbook. Those guys down there are packing heat. Shit, we're all packing heat. The cops don't care. Besides, what cops? Who ever sees a peeler around here except in Floridita? Anyway, it's 1992. Bush the First is president, Dinkins is mayor, Major is PM, John Paul is the pope. According to the New York <i>Daily News,</i> it was 55 degrees yesterday and raining in Belfast. Which is par for the course in the summer there. </p><p> With a handkerchief I wipe away the sweat from the little Buddha fat gathering on my belly. The train is never coming. Never. I wipe under my arms, too. I stamp out the fag and resist the temptation to light another. Are people giving me looks? I'm the only white person at the station and I'm going north up to Washington Heights, which, when you think about it, is just plain silly. </p><p> The guys wearing the wool hats are West Africans. I've seen them before. They sit there serene and composed, chittering about this and that and sometimes scratching out a game of dominoes. They're going downtown. On that side there's no shade, it's boiling on them and they're as mellow as you please. They sell watches from suitcases to marks on Fifth Avenue and Herald Square. I know their crew chief. He's only been in North America four months and he has a twelve-man unit. I like him. He's suave and he's an operator and he never flies off the handle. I'd work for him but he only employs other boys from the Gambia. If you've ever checked, it's a funny-looking country and I mentioned that to him one time and he told me all about the Brits, colonialism, structural exploitation, the Frankfurt School, and all that shite and we got on fine and laughed and he took a Camel but still wouldn't give me a job selling knockoff watches from a briefcase. And it's not like they're kin to him either, it's just a question of trust. He won't even hire Ghanaians. I can understand it. Do the same myself, more than likely. Today no dominoes, they're just talking. English, actually, but you can't follow it. No. </p><p> I put the hanky away and try and breathe for a while. Look around, breathe. The cars. The city. The river again: vulgar, stinking, vast, and in this haze, it and Harlem dissolving and despairing together. There are no swimmers, of course. Even the foolish aren't that foolish. </p><p> I look away from the water. In this direction you wouldn't believe how many empty lots there are, how many buildings are shells, how many roofs are burnt away, and it gets worse as you go east towards the Apollo. You can see it all since there's a fine view from up here where the IRT becomes elevated for a while. 126th Street, for example, is behind the state's massive Adam Clayton Powell Jr. building, where I got my driver's license and you get social security cards and stuff and you'd think that that would be prime real estate. But it isn't. Nearly every building is derelict for about three whole blocks. And 123rd, where I live, well, we'll get to that. </p><p> Yawn. Stand on tiptoes. Roll my head. Lazy stretch. </p><p> Aye. </p><p> Sooner or later -- minutes, hours -- the train is going to come and it's going to take me to 173rd Street and I'm going to meet Scotchy coming down from the Bronx and Scotchy is going to be late and he'll spin me lies about some girl he has going and then Scotchy and I will impose our collective will on a barkeep up there and after that just maybe the tight wee bastard will spring for a cab to get us down to the other bar on 163rd where we have a bit more serious work to do with a young man called Dermot Finoukin. Because walking those ten blocks would just about kill me on a day like this. He won't though, he'll make us walk. Nice wee dander for you, Bruce, he'll slabber. Yeah, that will be the way of it. Crap from Scotchy. Crap from Dermot. Down by myself. Dinner at KFC and a six-pack of beer from C-Town Supermarket for four dollars. Shit. </p><p> A black girl is talking to the Dominican boys outside the bodega and it's more Leonard Bernstein than ever as the hackles rise between the blacks and the Dominicans on this side of the street. Jesus, gunplay is all I need. Just make the train come and when it comes make the aircon work. But it doesn't and I look away from the boys in case afterwards I'm asked to be a witness by the peels. </p><p> Lights appear in the tunnel at the City College stop. The downtown train comes and the Gambians and the other passengers get on and it's just me now and a few wee muckers at the far end spitting down the sixty feet to Broadway beneath us. </p><p> A homeless man comes up the steps having leapt the barrier. He's filthy and he smells and he's going to ask me for a quarter. He's coughing and then he says: </p><p> Sir, spa-carter. </p><p> His hands are swollen to twice what they should be and he could have anything from untreated winter frostbite to fucking leprosy. </p><p> Here, I say, and I don't want to touch him, so I put the quarter on the ground and then immediately repent of this. How unbelievably humiliating to make a sixty-year-old man bend down and pick up a quarter. He does bend down, picks it up, thanks me, and wanders off. </p><p> The pay phone rings. Who knew the phone even worked? It rings and rings. The kids, spitting, look over at me, and eventually I go and pick it up. </p><p> Yes? I say. </p><p> Michael? a voice says. </p><p> Yes, I say, trying not to sound amazed. </p><p> It's Sunshine, he says. </p><p> Sunshine. Sunshine, how in the name of bloody Jehovah do you know this pay-phone number? I ask, giving up any attempt to play it cool. </p><p> I'm paid to know these things, he says mysteriously. </p><p> Yeah but -- </p><p> Listen, Michael, it's all off for today. Darkey's going to see the Boss and he's taking myself and Big Bob with him. The rest of you have the day off. Scotchy'll call you tomorrow. </p><p> All right, I say, and I'm going to ask him about money but he rings off. The prick. Sunshine is Darkey's right-hand man, and if ever there was a more weaselly-looking man-behind-the-man type of character, it's Sunshine. Thin, thinner than Scotchy even, with one of those skinny mustaches, and a bald head with a ridiculous comb-over that makes him look a bit like Hitler. I had him pegged for a child molester the minute I saw him but apparently that's not the case. Scotchy says not and Scotchy hates him. I don't. After you meet him a bit he's ok. Actually, I think he's a nice bloke, on the whole. </p><p> I hang up the phone and look foolishly at it for a second and one of the kids comes up and asks if it was for me. He's about ten, braver than the others, or more bored. Big hands that are restless behind him. Neat clothes, newish shoes. </p><p> I nod. </p><p> And who the fuck are you? he asks, squinting up at me and into the sunlight. </p><p> I-I'm the bogeyman, I say, and grin. </p><p> You ain't no boogy man, he says, his American pronunciation half accusing, half scared. After all, I can look intimidating on occasion. </p><p> You always do what your mother tells you? I ask. </p><p> Sometimes, he says, thrown by the question. </p><p> Well, listen. Next time you don't, don't be surprised if I'm under your bed or in your cupboard or out there on your fire escape. Waiting. </p><p> He turns and wanders off slowly, trying to appear unimpressed. Perhaps he is. Not easy alarming little kids around here. Christ, most of their goddamn grandmas scare the hell out of me. </p><p> Ok, home. No point lingering. I suppose it's impossible to get my token back since I didn't ride the train. I scope the clerk and she's a tough big lassie whose fucking shadow could kick my ass. She gives me the evil eye while I'm considering the options, so in the end I don't even bother. And then it's step, step, step down the broken escalator, which since I've been here has been unrepaired. Slime on the bottom step. </p><p> I turn and walk along 125th past the live chicken store and the discount liquor and the horrible doughnut shop and the thinly disguised All-Things-Catholic, but really All-Things-Santería store. Cross the street. A man in a makeshift stall is selling bananas, oranges, and some green fruit I don't know the name of. It's all well presented but with all this pollution and crap around here you wouldn't eat anything he's vending, you'd have to be fucking crazy. People are, of course, and there's a queue. </p><p> At the junction you stop and you take a long look. You have to. For it's all there. The traffic. The pedestrians. Bairns and dogs and men with limps outside under the overhang. The slick off the Jackie Robinson. Public Enemy blaring from the speakers, Chuck D and Flavor Flav outsnapping each other. The hotness and the sizzle and the crack and the craic. Dealers and buyers and everyone in between. It's rich and it's overwhelming but really, in Harlem, all is sweetness. No one bothers me. They take me in. It's a scene. It's like the beach. The moisture, the temperature, the people on the dunes of sidewalk and the great hulking seething city is, in this analogy, the dirty gray Atlantic Ocean. </p><p> Up the hill. It's only two blocks but by some freak of geography it's really the equivalent of about five. </p><p> I reach in my shorts for my keys and turn on 123rd. Vinny the Vet is ahead of me going in the building, having a full, angry conversation with no one at all. His shopping bag clinks. Danny the Drunk is on the corner in the sun propping himself up. That purple face is leaning down over his walking stick, dry retching. And me as the third representative of the Caucasian race on the street, what am I like? </p><p> Aye, what indeed. </p><p> Keys, pistol. Pistol, keys. </p><p> Nerves are bad. </p><p> Keys. But the lock is screwed up and I have to jiggle it. Must tell Ratko, not that he'll fix anything. But guilt-ridden by his laziness, he will invite me down for some foul Polish vodka and Serbian delicacies prepared last year or so by the missus. But at least in my warped brain it'll be home cooking. </p><p> Sounds like a plan. </p><p> It's 1992 and Serbs are beginning to get a bit of a bad reputation. But it's not so terrible yet. Ratko'll pour me a full tumbler of something clear and awful and we'll toast Gavrilo Princip or Tito or the memory of the bloody Knights of Kosovo and I'll have a cold sausage-and-lard sandwich and another glass and when the drink is sweating me close to a bloody heart attack I'll slink away and stumble up the three floors to the apartment. </p><p> Second thought, no. </p><p> Inside, Freddie's there doing the mail. </p><p> Freddie, I say, and we talk for a minute about sports. Freddie can see I'm beat, though, and lets me go. Nice chap, Freddie. </p><p> Go up the stairs. The door. Keys again. Inside. Hotter here than the street. I put on the telly for company. Free cable somehow. I look for something familiar and settle on Phil Spector and John Lennon and some irritated long-haired session musicians being lectured by Yoko Ono on chord progression. </p><p> Run the bath. Water comes out brown. Sit on the tub edge and have a brief premonition of the phone ringing and me picking it up and it's Sunshine, come over all ominous, saying that Darkey wants to see me. </p><p> I shiver, get up, and take the phone off the hook. Disrobe, climb into the bath. Light a fag. Convince myself that this phone call will never happen. Get out of the bath and actually disconnect the phone from the wall, think for a moment, lock the door, get my gun, check the mechanism, leave it where I can grab it. Climb into the bath again. Sink into nothingness. Sink. </p><p> *�&nbsp;�&nbsp;*�&nbsp;�&nbsp;* </p><p> Murmurs, hymnals, and in the vestry quiet whole colonies of insects give me kisses and I'm too buggered to do anything about it. Vodka spills from my mouth. I'm sleeping and on the shores of some immense creature's back, a giant bovine eye and blue nerves and a labyrinth of tentacles. Jesus. I get up out of the water, which is by now cold, and grab a towel. </p><p> Later. The phone, the TV. The heat. Fag after fag until the ashtray is full. The fridge works and brings me vodka with ice. Small mercies but mercies nonetheless. I lean back on the sofa and contemplate my surroundings. </p><p> And let me describe the beautiful haven Scotchy and Darkey have picked out for me. Not that I'm ungrateful. Took me in, gave me a place. But it's not as if I haven't earned my keep. Only one with two brain cells to rub together. Anyway. They, of course, live in the nice part of the Bronx at the end of the 1 line. But it was full up there, see? Scotchy's claim, anyway. More fool me to believe him. This place apparently is five hundred a month, which comes out of my pay. As did the furniture, which Scotchy admitted later he got all for sweet FA in the street. It's a one bedroom. A toilet whose stink greets you when you come in.

Romulo, portrays the Marcoses as a powerful and greedy political team, surrounded by sycophants and jetset friends, who exploited a still feudal society with a corrupt patronage system. While Imelda was noted for her lavish and frivolous lifestyle, the author emphasizes that her husband relied on her as a de facto vice-president to whom, as his health failed, he accorded increasing authority, sending her on missions that she combined with mammoth shopping sprees. In this gossipy, meaty expose, studded with frank appraisals of public figures, the author contrasts the glamorous life of the privileged few, which she admittedly enjoyed, with the dire poverty of the Philippine people. Her eyewitness account of the disintegration and toppling of the regime after Benigno Aquino's murder confirms other such reports. Photos not seen by PW.

Cantor, proves once and for all that popular culture can be every bit as complex, meaningful, and provocative as the most celebrated works of literature--and a lot more fun. Cantor analyzes and interprets a wide variety of classic television programs with the same seriousness, care, and creativity as he would Hamlet or Macbeth to reveal how dramatically America&#39;s image of itself has evolved from the 1960s to the present.

He served on the National Council on the Humanities from 1992 to 1999. He is the author of books and numerous essays on Shakespeare, Romanticism, literary theory, comparative literature, and many other subjects.A provocative book about the changes in pop culture during the last four decades. (<i>The Washington Times</i>)<br><br>A brilliant professor turns TV critic, and finds literature, politics, and philosophy in four favorite series from the 1960s to the 1990s. Paul Cantor makes wonderful sense in simple prose of America's slide toward globalization, as seen on TV. An innovative book bursting with wit, a treat for the mind. It may make you believe that watching TV is not a total waste of time. (Harvey Mansfield, Harvard University)<br><br><i>Gilligan Unbound</i> is a fun read and a deep analysis&#x2014;altogether an amazing achievement. As a lively and perceptive student of our culture, Cantor can't be beat. (William Kristol, The Weekly Standard)<br><br>Paul Cantor is a serious theorist who takes popular culture seriously&#x2014;but with a light touch. What he gives us is a book with genuine insight into the nature of our times, one that shows how examination of the everyday can lead us directly to the deepest questions of human life and philosophy. (Francis Fukuyama, author of <i>The End of History and the Last Man<i>)<br><br>As a student of American popular culture, Paul Cantor is the best. His scholarship is wonderful, learned, generous, and luminous. Cantor sees the serious dimension of ostensibly trivial things&#x2014;and the trivial in the ostensibly serious&#x2014;and he gives his readers remarkable access to the American soul. <i>Gilligan Unbound</i> is a grand book, indispensable for anyone who wants to understand contemporary American life and thought. (Wilson Carey McWilliams, Rutgers University)<br><br>What the hell is he talking about? (author of "Cultural Literacy")<br><br>Cantor provides a fascinating frame for discussions of popular culture. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Brilliant book. Books on television written by academics are always terrible. <i>Gilligan Unbound</i> is the exception that proves the rule. Cantor's book succeeds despite the fact that it is about television. His insights about life today are so intelligent that they sparkle despite being expressed in the context of pop-culture criticism. (<i>The Weekly Standard</i>)<br><br>Paul A. Cantor is a strange creature: a conservative professor of English at the University of Virginia who specializes in Shakespeare, loves pop culture, and is flat-out funny. . . . What makes Cantor's reflections impressive and credible is that, like a thimbleful of other conservatives such as Thomas Hibbs and John Podhoretz, Cantor absorbs the culture. He understands that it houses the bad and the good. (Jonathan V. Last <i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br>In this interesting book, Paul Cantor wants to see how globalization has itself become a theme in specific TV programs, and how they express changing attitudes toward the process. Cantor does not hide behind the scholarly jargon and methodoly so many popular culture scholars employ&#x2014;scholars writing about the interests of the common man in terms the common man can never understand. In short, he takes popular culture seriously, but not too seriously. This book asks for a new respect for our popular culture and its role in our society.

Alvar Olsen was blathering on about something, gesticulating wildly and waving a set of papers. But Salander could not hear a word he said. It was 7:30 p.m.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the most dangerous time at Flodberga Prison. Seven-thirty p.m. was when the daily freight train thundered past; the walls shook and keys rattled and the place smelled of sweat and perfume. All the worst abuses took place then, masked by the racket from the railway and in the general confusion just before the cell doors were shut. Salander always let her gaze wander back and forth over the unit at this time of day and it was probably no coincidence that she caught sight of Faria Kazi.<br> &nbsp;<br> Faria was young and beautiful, from Bangladesh, and she was sitting in her cell. From where Salander and Olsen stood, all Salander could see was her face. Someone was slapping Faria. Her head kept jerking from side to side, though the blows were not that hard&#x2014;there was something almost routine about them. It was clear from Faria&#x2019;s humiliated expression that the abuse had been going on for a long time and had broken her will to resist.<br> &nbsp;<br> No hands were raised to try to stop the slapping, and in Faria&#x2019;s eyes&nbsp;there was no indication of surprise, only a mute, dull fear. This terror was part of her life. Salander could see that just by studying her face, and it matched what she had observed during her weeks at the prison.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Will you look at that,&#x201d; she said, pointing into Faria&#x2019;s cell.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But by the time Olsen had turned to look, it was over. Salander disappeared into her own cell and closed the door. She could hear voices and muffled laughter in the corridor and outside the freight train clanging by, shaking the walls. She stood in front of the shiny washbasin and narrow bed, the bookshelf and desk strewn with pages of her quantum mechanical calculations. Did she feel like doing more work on loop quantum gravity theory? She realized she was holding something and looked down at her hand.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the same sheaf of papers that Olsen had been waving around, and that did, after all, make her a little curious. But it was some sort of rubbish with coffee cup rings all over the cover page: an intelligence test. Ridiculous. She hated to be prodded and measured.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She dropped the papers which spread like a fan on the concrete floor. For a brief moment they vanished from her mind as her thoughts went back to Faria Kazi. Salander had not seen who was hitting her. But she knew perfectly well who it was. Although at first prison life had not interested Salander, reluctantly she had been drawn in, decoding the visible and invisible signals one by one. By now she understood who called the shots.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This was called the B Unit, the secure section. It was considered the safest place in the institution, and to a visitor that might have been how it seemed. There were more guards, more controls and more rehabilitation programmes here than anywhere else in the prison. But anyone who took a closer look would realize there was something rotten about the place. The guards put on an act, exuding authority, and they even pretended to care. But in fact they were cowards who had lost control, and they had ceded power to their chief antagonists, gang leader Benito Andersson and her mob.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> During the day Benito kept a low profile and behaved like a model prisoner, but after the evening meal, when the inmates could exercise or&nbsp;receive visits, she took over. At this time of day her reign of terror was uncontested, just before the doors were locked for the night. As the prisoners roamed between cells, making threats and promises in whispered tones, Benito&#x2019;s gang kept to one side, their victims to the other.<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> The fact that Salander was in prison at all was a major scandal. But circumstances had hardly been on her side, nor had she put up a very convincing fight. The interlude seemed absurd to her, but she also thought she might just as well be in jail as anywhere else.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had been sentenced to two months for unlawful use of property and reckless endangerment in the dramatic events following the murder of Professor Frans Balder. Salander had taken it upon herself to hide his eight-year-old autistic son and refused to cooperate with the police because she believed&#x2014;quite rightly&#x2014;that the police investigation had been betrayed. No-one disputed that she went to heroic lengths to save the child&#x2019;s life. Even so, Chief Prosecutor Richard Ekstr�m led the case with great conviction, and the court ultimately found against her, although one of the lay judges dissented. Salander&#x2019;s lawyer, Annika Giannini, had done an outstanding job. But she got virtually no help from her client, so that in the end Salander did not stand a chance. She maintained a sullen silence throughout the trial and refused to appeal the verdict. She simply wanted to get the business over with.<br> &nbsp;<br> At first she was sent to Bj�rng�rda G�rd open prison, where she had a lot of freedom. Then new information surfaced, suggesting there were people who wanted to harm her. This was not entirely unexpected, given the enemies she had made, so she was transferred to the secure wing at Flodberga.<br> &nbsp;<br> Salander had no problem sharing space with Sweden&#x2019;s most notorious female criminals. She was constantly surrounded by guards, and no assaults or violence had been reported in the unit for many years. Records also showed that an impressive number of inmates had been rehabilitated. But those statistics all came from the time before the arrival of Benito Andersson.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> From the day Salander arrived at the prison, she faced a variety of provocations. She was a high-profile prisoner known from media coverage, not to mention the rumours that spread through the underworld. Only a few days earlier, Benito had put a note in her hand which read: friend or enemy? Salander had thrown it away after a minute&#x2014;it took about fifty-eight seconds before she could be bothered to read it.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She had no interest in power struggles or alliances. She concentrated on observing and learning, and by now she felt she had learned more than enough. She stared blankly at her bookshelf, stocked with the essays on quantum field theory she had ordered before she landed inside. In the cupboard on the left were two changes of prison clothes, all stamped with the initials of the prison service, plus some underwear and two pairs of sneakers. There was nothing on the walls, not a single reminder of life on the outside. She cared no more for the surroundings in her cell than those in her home on Fiskargatan.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cell doors were being shut along the corridor and normally that meant some freedom for Salander. When the noise died down, she could lose herself in mathematics&#x2014;in attempts to combine quantum mechanics with the theory of relativity&#x2014;and forget the world around her. But tonight was different. She was irritated, and not just because of the abuse of Faria Kazi or the rampant corruption in the unit.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She could not stop thinking about the visit six days earlier from Holger Palmgren, her old guardian from the time when the authorities had decided she was incapable of taking care of herself. The visit had been a major production. Palmgren was entirely dependent on home aides and assistants and hardly ever left his apartment in Liljeholmen. But he had been adamant. The social service&#x2019;s subsidized transport service brought him in his wheelchair, as he wheezed into an oxygen mask. Salander was glad to see him.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She and Palmgren had spoken of old times and he had become sentimental and emotional. There was just one thing that troubled Salander. Palmgren told her that a woman by the name of Maj-Britt Torell had&nbsp;been to see him. She used to be a secretary at St. Stefan&#x2019;s psychiatric clinic for children, where Salander had been a patient. The woman had read about Salander in the newspapers and brought Palmgren some documents which she believed he might find interesting. According to Palmgren it was more of the same old horror stories about how Salander had been strapped to her bed in the clinic and subjected to the worst kind of psychological abuse. &#x201c;Nothing you need to see,&#x201d; he said. Still, something must have stood out, because when Palmgren asked about her dragon tattoo and the woman with the birthmark, he said:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t she from the Registry?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Registry for the Study of Genetics and Social Environment in Uppsala? I thought I read that somewhere.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The name must have been in those new documents,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think so? Perhaps I&#x2019;m just muddling it all up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps he was. Palmgren had grown old. Yet the information stuck in Salander&#x2019;s mind. It had gnawed at her while she trained on the speedball in the gym in the afternoons and worked in the ceramics workshop in the mornings. It gnawed away at her now as she stood in her cell looking down at the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Somehow the I.Q. test which lay spread across the concrete no longer seemed irrelevant, but rather a continuation of her conversation with Palmgren. For a moment Salander could not grasp why. Then she remembered that the woman with the birthmark had given her all kinds of tests in those days. They always ended in arguments and eventually with Salander, at the age of just six, escaping into the night.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet what was most striking about these memories was not the tests or her running away, but the growing suspicion that there was something fundamental about her childhood she did not understand. She knew she had to find out more.<br> &nbsp;<br> True, she would soon be outside again and free to do as she wanted. But she also knew she had leverage with Warden Olsen. This was not the first time he had chosen to turn a blind eye to abuses, and the unit he headed, still a source of pride in the prison service, was in a state of moral&nbsp;decay. Salander guessed she could get Olsen to give her access to something no-one else in the prison was allowed&#x2014;an Internet connection.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She listened for sounds in the corridor. Muttered curses could be heard, along with doors being slammed, keys rattling and footsteps tapping off into the distance. Then silence fell. The only noise came from the ventilation system. It was broken&#x2014;the air was stifling, unbearable&#x2014;but still humming away. Salander looked at the papers on the floor and thought about Benito, Faria Kazi and Alvar Olsen&#x2014;and the woman with the fiery birthmark on her throat.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She bent to pick up the test, sat down at the desk and scribbled out some answers. Then she pressed the intercom button by the steel door. Olsen picked up after a long interval, sounding nervous. She said she needed to talk to him right away.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s important,&#x201d; she said.</p><h2>Before the Wall: Berlin Days, 1946-1948</h2><p>A British intelligence officer in Allied-occupied Berlin describes the four-way battle for control of the hearts and minds of the city&#39;s people in the years immediately following World War II</p><p>Born Georg Klaar in Austria in 1920, the author emigrated to England after the Anschluss (recalled movingly in his Last Waltz in Vienna ) and served in the British Army for the next decade. Here he focuses on his experiences in postwar Berlin, where his unit licensed Germans for work in the arts and media--provided they were "de-Nazified." He tells of a few admirable Germans--such as the widow of an anti-Nazi general executed by Hitler who wanted no special treatment, and a teenage SS member who insisted on being arrested for war crimes--and the many others who claimed to have been anti-Nazi until Clare confronted them with their Nazi Party files. The book convincingly captures the mood of Berlin at a time when Soviet-Western relations cooled, Allied soldiers lived like princes and some Germans slowly began coming to grips with their history. Perhaps most striking are Clare's surprisingly generous feelings toward the citizens of the regime that killed his parents. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Driven by a need to understand the genesis of Nazism and world war, the author, an Austrian who lost his parents to Hitler, went to Germany in 1946 as an interpreter with the British occupational force. As he became involved in efforts to catch ex-Nazis who were trying to hide their pasts, Clare saw the fullness of justice in punishing, but forgiving, the Germans. He ends his memoir with a trip to his birth city Vienna, where he finds that he has truly left the past behind. He concludes that the Hitler phenomenon could have happened in other nations, but Germany was most ready for it. Although episodic and somewhat erratic, the book provides a unique and interesting perspective on historic events.

The epic story of Catherine and Heathcliff plays out against the dramatic backdrop of the wild English moors, and presents an astonishing metaphysical vision of fate and obsession, passion and revenge. "Only Emily Bront�," V. S. Pritchett said, "exposes her imagination to the dark spirit." And Virginia Woolf wrote, "Hers...is the rarest of all powers. She could free life from its dependence on facts...by speaking of the moor make the wind blow and the thunder roar."

Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is edited by Richard Hoyes, Head of English and Media Studies, Farnham College, Surrey."My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I <i>am</i> Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure... but as my own being." <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is the only novel of Emily Bronte, who died a year after its publication, at the age of thirty. A brooding Yorkshire tale of a love that is stronger than death, it is also a fierce vision of metaphysical passion, in which heaven and hell, nature and society, are powerfully juxtaposed. Unique, mystical, with a timeless appeal, it has become a classic of English literature.</p><h2>Pippi Goes on Board</h2><p>Pippi&#39;s back with more absurd adventures!

And for a while, that was enough.</p><p>From the early rush of exploration to the day she learned to quiet the desperation and allow herself to love and be loved, Kerry's story is never less than riveting. In rich and immediate detail, <em>Loose Girl</em> re-creates what it feels like to be in that desperate moment, when a girl tries to control a boy by handing over her body, when the touch of that boy seems to offer proof of something, but ultimately delivers little more than emptiness.</p><p>Kerry Cohen's journey from that hopeless place to her current confident and fulfilled existence is a cautionary tale and a revelation for girls young and old. The unforgettable memoir of one young woman who desperately wanted to matter, <em>Loose Girl</em> will speak to countless others with its compassion, understanding, and love.</p></p><p><strong>Kerry Cohen</strong> is a psychotherapist who works with teens and their families. She received her MFA in creative writing from the University of Oregon and an MA in counseling psychology. A mother of two, she is a native of New Jersey but makes her home in Portland, Oregon.Despite the rather prurient title, Cohen's memoir is a deeply poignant, desperately sad account of a confused, directionless adolescent girl's free fall into self-abnegation. Growing up affluent in New Jersey in the 1980s and smarting from the recent breakup of her parents, 11-year-old Cohen begins to recognize the power her nubile body has over men. Being wanted becomes her greatest hope; once she and her older sister, Tyler, begin living with her father when her mother decides to attend med school in the Philippines, she latches onto other girls with whom she treks into New York City to bar hop at places like Dorian's Red Hand and pick up older, eager boys. Stunningly, the father is not alarmed by her early-morning absences, but seems to encourage her popularity, buying her clothes and treating her as a grownup. Gradually, hooking up with boys becomes a need, a way to bolster her faltering sense of self-worth. A litany of dreary sex acts follows with young men she doesn't particularly like and who don't like her, regardless of STD scares and a college rape. The painter mother of one of her boyfriends does initiate her into more intellectual pursuits, awakening a redemptive desire to become a writer. Cohen's memoir of a lost childhood is commendably honest and frequently excruciating to read. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Images of Steens country&#x2014;wild sagebrush and juniper country, with rugged vistas in every direction&#x2014;are woven throughout her recollections, which share the profound sense of place found in the best Western memoirs. While vividly describing ranch life, Child of Steens Mountain also explores universal issues of parenting, making a living, and growing up. The homesteading life built a child&#x2019;s character and confidence, and as she reaches adulthood, McVicker, raised to be independent and responsible, ultimately defies her parents to follow her own path.McVicker&#x2019;s neighbor and friend, Barbara J. Scot, edited and organized the narration while preserving the author&#x2019;s distinctive voice. In an afterword, Scot reflects on McVicker&#x2019;s experiences and describes the collaborative process&#x2014;including a visit to the old homestead site&#x2014;that led to this book. Historian Richard Etulain, whose own childhood was spent on a sheep ranch in the West, provides an overview of sheep ranching and homesteading in Steens country in his foreword.Whether intrigued by Oregon history, the high desert country, or memoirs of homesteading life, readers will be unable to resist these appealing stories of growing up amid the natural beauty of Steens country.</p><p>For Eileen O&#x2019;Keeffe McVicker, growing up on a homestead in the West made for &#x201c;a hard, happy life with layers of riches.&#x201d; McVicker&#x2019;s memoir of a childhood spent on the southern slope of Steens Mountain offers a real-life, personal account of eastern Oregon history.

Using a variety of primary sources, official records, interviews, and unpublished memoirs by the veterans themselves, author Flint Whitlock has crafted a riveting, gut-wrenching, personal story of courage under fire. Operation Overlord - the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 - was arguably the most important battle of World War II, and Omaha Beach was the hottest spot in the entire operation. Leading the amphibious assault on the "Easy Red" and "Fox Green" sectors of Omaha Beach was the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division - "The Big Red One" - a tough, swaggering outfit with a fine battle record. The saga of the Big Red One, however, did not end with the storming of the beachhead. The author concludes with an account of the 1st in their fight across France, Belgium, and into Germany itself, playing pivotal roles in the bloody battles for Aachen, the Huertgen Forest, and the Battle of the Bulge. <i>The Fighting First</i> is an inspiring, graphic, and often heartbreaking story of young American soldiers performing their D-Day missions with spirit, humor, and determination.</p><p>Pulitzer Prize-nominated author <b>Flint Whitlock</b> is a former U.S. Army officer who served on active duty from 1965 to 1970, including a tour in Vietnam. He has been a military historian since 1986 and is the author of <i>Soldiers on Skis, The Rock of Anzio</i>, and <i>The Fighting First</i>. He is a regular contributor to <i>World War II</i> magazine and <i>WW II History</i> magazine. He is the president of the newly formed Colorado Military History Museum, Inc. He lives in Denver, Colorado.The author of two other WWII histories (Soldiers on Skis and The Rock of Anzio), Whitlock now focuses on the often overlooked 1st Infantry Division that, along with the well-chronicled 29th Division, stormed Omaha beach during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Nicknamed "The Big Red One," the 1st Division was already seasoned in the North Africa and Sicily campaigns and expected to be transferred from the Mediterranean to a cushy job training green recruits stateside. Instead, the haggard, battle-hardy division was sent to England to train for Operation Overload under a new commander, Clarence Huebner. Through interviews, unpublished manuscripts and other primary sources, Whitlock recounts their determined, if exhausted, preparation for the invasion of France: they stoically survived warm British beer and rigorously trained replacements for their fallen brothers-in-arms. Burdened with every piece of equipment they could possibly need (and some they didn&#x2019;t), the 1st fought their way through barbed wire, mines and machine guns, past formidable German fortifications and into the hedgerow country beyond the beach cliffs. They won three D-Day Medals of Honor for those 12 hours of fighting alone. The rest of the book covers the high points of the European campaign, moving along with the 1st through street fighting in Aachen, the Battle of the Bulge and the liberation of Bonn. Altogether this book is a worthwhile chronicle of a small group of worn-out men who were called to do yet another duty and did it well. 50 b&amp;w photographs, 20 maps <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Written with a narrative drive reminiscent of Barbara Tuchman's <i>A Distant Mirror,</i> this new work takes us back to a medieval Iberia that prefigured the Renaissance. <br> In 711, a ragtag army of Muslim North Africans conquered Christian Spain and launched Western Europe's first (and to date only) Islamic state. In 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella vanquished Spain's last Muslim kingdom, forced Jews to convert or emigrate, and dispatched Christopher Columbus to the New World. In the years between, Spain's Muslims, Christians, and Jews forged a golden age for each faith and distanced Spain from a Europe mired in the Dark Ages. <br> Medieval Spain's pioneering innovations touched every dimension of Western life: Spaniards introduced Europeans to paper manufacture and to the Hindu-Arabic numerals that supplanted the Roman numeral system. Spanish scholars translated what stood for centuries as Europe's standard medical handbook. Spain's farmers adopted irrigation technology from the Near East to nurture Europe's first crops of citrus and cotton. Spanish artisans graced luxurious homes with the fountains, gardens, and decorative tile that remain hallmarks of southern Spain's distinctive decor. Spain's religious scholars authored works that still profoundly influence their respective faiths, from the masterpiece of the Jewish kabbalah to the meditations of Sufism's "greatest master" to the eloquent arguments of Maimonides that humans can successfully marry religious faith and reasoned philosophical inquiry. No less astonishing than medieval Spain's wide-ranging accomplishments was the simple fact its Muslims, Christians, and Jews often managed to live and work side by side, bestowing tolerance and freedom of worship on the religious minorities in their midst. <br> <i>A Vanished World</i> chronicles this impossibly panoramic sweep of human history and achievement, encompassing both the agony of jihad, Crusades, and Inquisition, and the glory of a multireligious, multicultural civilization that forever changed the West. One gnarled root of today's religious animosities stretches back to medieval Spain, but so does a more nourishing root of much modern religious wisdom. In a world torn by religious antagonism, Chris Lowney offers enduring lessons learned from medieval Spanish villages where Muslims, Christians, and Jews rubbed shoulders on a daily basis.</p><p><b>Chris Lowney</b> is the author of <i>Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World</i>, the acclaimed history chronicling the transformation of sixteenth-century Jesuits into their era&#x2019;s most successful &#x201c;company.&#x201d; A former Jesuit, Lowney holds degrees in medieval history and philosophy.

And imagine a world in which everything worth knowing filled a mere few hundred pages. Archbishop Isidore of Seville was such a person, and seventh-century Europe such a world.<br><br>Lest Isidore be accused of vanity unbecoming an archbishop, he himself never claimed to be the Man Who Knew Everything. Rather, it was his friend Bishop Braulio of Saragossa who gushed that Isidore's seventh-century encyclopedia comprised "well-nigh everything that ought to be known." Unfortunately, few of Isidore's contemporaries perused that encyclopedia. There were few Europeans to begin with, only a minute fraction of them literate, and books were rare treasures.<br><br>Today's Spain enjoys a population of some 40 million. Isidore's Spain was a far lonelier place, with perhaps only a tenth as many people; imagine Utah's sparse population scattered across an expanse twice as large. The written word was an impenetrable mystery to the overwhelming majority of these 4 or 5 million Spaniards. Organized education was nonexistent, save for a few monastic or cathedral schools that labored to equip clerics with the rudimentary skills required for church rituals.<br><br>Though Spain's (and Europe's) literate population was tiny, the medieval "publishing industry" struggled to service its few readers. A modern printing press effortlessly churns out many thousands of volumes each day; a medieval scribe would be lucky to turn out two in a <i>year.</i> That was after he and his monastic brethren invested sweaty hours of soaking animal hide, scraping away fat, and stretching, curing, and drying the skin to produce serviceable vellum parchment. No wonder the few texts emerging from this labor-intensive process became precious items. Whereas bibliophiles today might scoop up a handful of used books for the cost of a hamburger, a ninth-century manuscript would have cost the equivalent of "fifteen pigs or four mature sheep."<br><br>Spain's illiterate majority was deprived of Isidore's intellectual cornucopia, but they also were spared the depressing realization that they lived in a Dark Age. Perspective was hard to come by in an era when most Europeans knew little of the world beyond the next village and little of the past save what their parents recalled. No Spaniard knew that he lived in a country of some 4 or 5 million people, much less that Spain had sheltered many more before devastating plagues ravaged much of Europe's population. The plummeting population had plunged Spain's (and Europe's) economy into a depression that was exacerbated when barbarian hordes breached the Roman Empire's borders, disrupted trade, and strained the empire's resources to the breaking point.<br><br>What was unknown to Spaniards made little practical difference to their daily lives. Peasants scratched out meager livelihoods; surviving the next winter was their major preoccupation. Their horizons were bound by their village and its environs, just as it had been for parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. Surviving to a first birthday was no mean feat, and celebrating a fortieth a better than average achievement. The outside world seldom visited them, and they seldom visited the outside world. For all they knew, the world was proceeding as the world always had.<br><br>Through the curse of literacy, Bishop Braulio knew better. The few books in his library made reference to classical scholars who had blazed a more enlightened path forward for humanity's earlier generations. But while Braulio knew names like Aristotle, Galen, and Ptolemy, he also knew that most of their works had long since vanished from circulation, presumably lost forever. Nor had Braulio's century spawned intellectual lights to replace those of ancient Greece and Rome. Most civilizations harbor at least the illusion of progress, that humanity is somehow struggling forward under their generation's collective watch. Braulio was permitted no such illusion, and Isidore became for him a beacon from humanity's happier past: "God raised [Isidore] up in recent times after the many reverses of Spain (I suppose to revive the works of the ancients that we might not always grow duller from boorish rusticity)...we apply to him the famous words of [Cicero] 'While we were strangers in our own city, and were, so to speak, sojourners who had lost our way, your books brought us home, as it were, so that we could at last recognize who and where we were.'"<br><br>Ironically, this Isidore who outlined "everything that ought to be known" revealed relatively little about himself. He was born in 560. His parents died young. He had two brothers who both became priests and rose to the rank of bishop. It's difficult to imagine any one family duplicating this episcopal achievement today, but such feats were less astounding in the cozier confines of medieval Spain, where relatively few well-connected, well-endowed, and literate families surfaced regularly in influential church or state positions.<br><br>It is generally assumed that Isidore was raised in monastery precincts overseen by his much older brother, Bishop Leander. One might imagine a lonely childhood spent mostly in the company of monks and the precious texts they copied and preserved. The scholarly environment clearly absorbed Isidore, who eventually authored over a dozen major treatises on everything from arithmetic to Holy Scripture to monastic rules. In between sentences he somehow found time to cope with the countless administrative headaches that inevitably plague a bishop.<br><br>The encyclopedic work known as the <i>Etymologies</i> was one pinnacle of his scholarly career. Braulio's compliment that it includes "everything that ought to be known" seems at first glance no exaggeration. Isidore's chapter headings map out a comprehensive catalogue of human knowledge: "size of the sun, size of the moon, acute diseases, legal instruments, the seasons, Old and New Testaments, God, monsters, human monstrosities, serpents, worms, small flying creatures, shields, helmets, the circus, gambling, peculiar costumes of certain peoples, head ornaments for women, girdles, footwear, cooking utensils," and so on. Isidore telescoped this encyclopedic gallop through human learning into a relatively slender volume. Centuries before, Greek and Roman attempts at encyclopedias had yielded far bulkier tomes. Pliny the Elder's first-century encyclopedia sprawled to some 2,500 chapters. But Isidore lived in an age when, sad to say, the pool of human knowledge was slowly evaporating. Simply put, humanity knew less than it had six centuries earlier, in Pliny's day.<br><br>Scientific method was many centuries in the future, and Isidore did little more than absorb the sources at his fingertips and regurgitate what struck him as plausible. Early in the work, Isidore shares the relatively humdrum observation, "An even number is that which can be divided into two equal parts, as II, IV, VIII." Within a few pages, however, he has departed math's timeless certainties for a fantastic tour of human monstrosities:<br><br>The Cynocephali are so called because they have dogs' heads and their very barking betrays them as beasts rather than men. These are born in India...The Blemmyes, born in Libya, are believed to be headless trunks, having mouth and eyes in the breast; others are born without necks, with eyes in their shoulders...They say the Panotii in Scythia have ears of so large a size that they cover the whole body with them...The race of the Sciopodes...have one leg apiece, and are of a marvelous swiftness...in summertime they lie on the ground on their backs and are shaded by the greatness of their feet...The Antipodes in Libya have feet turned backward and eight toes on each foot.<br><br>Seville's conscientious shepherd, apparently fretting that this freakish catalogue will render his readers susceptible to believing all sorts of nonsense, closes the chapter by warning against gullibility: "Other fabulous monstrosities of the human race are said to exist, but they do not; they are imaginary."<br><br>Isidore and his contemporaries may not have known as much as the Romans and Greeks before them, but what they <i>thought</i> they knew was marvelous. Long before the scientific revolution's rational dissection of natural phenomena turned textbooks into soporific tomes, here was a world of wonders great and small. Isidore's encyclopedia sang of a blazing sun racing across the skies each day, and "after it comes to the west and has bathed itself in ocean, it passes by unknown ways beneath the earth, and again returns to the east." No less entrancing is the lowly bee, "skillful in the business of producing honey...they flee from smoke, and are enraged by noise...A good many have proved by experiment that these spring from the carcasses of cattle."<br><br>Still, before dismissing what passed for seventh-century knowledge, one pauses to wonder how well current wisdom will stand up over an equivalent interim. Today's cutting-edge science and technology may by 3400 C.E. seem no less buffoonish than some of Isidore's assertions appear. How will that glorious artifact of twentieth-century technology, the gas-powered automobile, strike Earth's citizens fourteen centuries hence as they tool around in whatever contraptions they've engineered to navigate a planet long since sucked dry of fossil fuels? Indeed, who even <i>one century</i> from now will consult an encyclopedia assembled in 2004? Who today can even <i>find</i> an encyclopedia composed in 1904?<br><br>Unlike 1904 encyclopedias, Isidore's <i>Etymologies</i> was consulted a century after its composition, and two centuries later, and eight more centuries later still. No less than ten editions of the <i>Etymologies</i> were published after the 1400s, a striking compliment to this beacon of light shining forth from the Dark Ages. Across a full two-century sweep of the intellectually barren early Middle Ages, Isidore stood alone as western Europe's only major compiler of secular knowledge. When contemporaries eulogized him as <i>saeculorum doctissimus</i> ("the most learned of the ages"), it was not sentimental puffery; there were few other candidates.<br><br>Isidore would have been greatly surprised to find scholars consulting his works in the 1500s, as he almost certainly doubted the world would last so long. In the late 500s, Pope Gregory the Great had taken stock of humankind's bleak prospects and solemnly moaned, "The world grows old and hoary and hastens to approaching death." There's every indication Isidore shared His Holiness's outlook. Like many Christian apologists before him, Isidore envisioned history unfolding according to a divinely ordained design. Starting with creation's seven days and continuing with venerably vital Adam, who sired a son at age 230, Isidore charted history's path with striking precision. As he wrote in the 630s, Isidore calculated the world's exact age to be 5,825 years. He dots humanity's time line with a curiously chosen panoply of the famous and infamous: Homer was at work during the world's 4,125th year, Plato in its 4,793rd; Cleopatra (5,150) and Nero (5,266) also merit mention. (In fact, only eight centuries separate Homer [c. eighth century B.C.E.] from Nero [d. 68 C.E.], not the thousand-plus years Isidore supposed. Thus, Isidore overestimated the glorious era of the ancient Greeks and Romans, while shrinking the thousands of years of pre-Homeric civilization into a scant four millennia.)<br><br>Vastly more important than this mere tally of years was history's underlying pattern. Though Isidore frequently parroted the few classical works at his disposal, his vision of history notably departs from those pagan sources. Aristotle had noted the planets' ever repeating orbits and ventured in oddly matter-of-fact language the extraordinarily depressing conjecture that "probably each art and science has often been developed as far as possible and has again perished." Round and round. Going nowhere.<br><br>Isidore demurred, instead hearkening to the fifth-century Christian bishop Augustine, who saw history unfurling purposefully through time toward the goal of creating a City of God on Earth. God had initiated human history by breathing life into Adam's nostrils in Eden; Adam had fallen, but humankind was inexorably making its way back to the Creator. Mighty Rome and all other earthly kingdoms would yield in time to a greater empire dominated by the Christian virtues, "whose king is truth, whose law is love, whose measure is eternity." As Augustine saw it, this Divine City of those following God's will was steadily gaining ground and would win increasing sway over humankind in preparation for that moment when Jesus would return in glory to judge the living and the dead.<br><br>Like his mentor Augustine, Isidore imagined the drama of human history unfolding in seven great epochs paralleling the biblical days during which God had created all earthly things. As Isidore wrote, the world was deep into what he considered its sixth and (ominously) final age before the figurative seventh or Sabbath day, when the redeemed would rest in God. This sixth age had begun with Jesus's nativity in 5211 and had already stretched far longer than humanity's fourth or fifth eras. Indeed, only the age of long-lived Adam and the other biblical greats had endured longer than a millennium. Still, if Isidore was preparing his readers for the approaching climax of this old and hoary world, even the Man Who Knew Everything didn't dare pinpoint the precise date of the Lord's long-anticipated second coming, for, he tells us, "The remainder of the sixth age is known to God alone."<br><br>Although Isidore did not know when the world might end, he was pretty sure that his beloved Spain would be center stage, ruled over since the late fifth century by a dynasty of one-time barbarians known as the Visigoths. To his credit, Isidore admirably restrains himself from excessively fawning over his native country in his <i>Etymologies</i> -- encyclopedias are objective, after all -- but he more than compensates in another work, the <i>History of the Kings of the Goths.</i> Its very first sentence rushes right to the chauvinistic point: "Of all the lands from the west to the Indies, you, Spain, O sacred and always fortunate mother of princes and peoples, are the most beautiful...You are the pride and the ornament of the world, the most illustrious part of the earth...you are rich with olives...your mountains full of trees, and your shores full of fish."<br><br>Much of Isidore's <i>History of the Goths</i> seems an exercise in what modern generations would call spin doctoring. The Visigoths had become protectors and supporters of Spain's Christian Church by Isidore's day, and Isidore thought it in the Church's interest to support the Visigoths by burnishing their reputation. This was no easy task, even for the Man Who Knew Everything. For the Visigoths were not really Spaniards, nor, when first reaching Spain during the early fifth century, had they professed the Church's version of Christianity, nor, finally, had Spain prospered on their royal watch. Bishop Braulio had wistfully lamented Spain's "many reverses" over preceding centuries. It fell to Isidore to convince readers that the same Visigoth rulers who had presided over those "many reverses" were worthy of "the most illustrious part" of a world now deep into its decisive sixth age.<br><br>That the Visigoths were themselves immigrants hardly made them oddities in Spain's ethnic paella pot. African Iberians and northern European Celts had been filtering into Spain for centuries before Christ's birth. Jews from the Near East may have established small trading communities as early as the first century C.E. The Peninsula remained a polyglot amalgamation of ethnic fiefdoms ...</p><h2>Sir Agravaine</h2><p>SOME time ago, when spending a delightful week-end at the ancestral castle of my dear old friend, the Duke of Weatherstonhope (pronounced Wop), I came across an old black-letter MS. It is on this that the story which follows is based. I have found it necessary to touch the thing up a little here and there, for writers in those days were weak in construction. Their idea of telling a story was to take a long breath and start droning away without any stops or dialogue till the thing was over. I have also condensed the title. In the original it ran, &#39;&#34;How it came about that ye good Knight Sir Agravaine ye Dolorous of ye Table Round did fare forth to succour a damsel in distress and after divers journeyings and perils by flood and by field did win her for his bride and right happily did they twain live ever afterwards,&#34; by Ambrose ye monk.&#39;</p><p>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (P. G. Wodehouse) was an English humorist and writer best known for his Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels. Educated at boarding schools, Wodehouse turned to writing at a young age, demonstrating great skill at humorous sketches and musical lyrics. He continued to write part-time while pursuing, at the behest of his father, a career in banking, and successfully contributed numerous pieces to Punch, Vanity Fair, and The Daily Express, among other publications. In addition to his literary work, Wodehouse was incorporated into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in recognition of his collaboration with Cole Porter on Anything Goes, his lyrics to the song Bill from Show Boat, and his work on the musicals Rosalie and The Three Musketeers. <p>While interned along with other British citizens in Germany during the Second World War, Wodehouse made a series of radio broadcasts for which he was accused of being a collaborator; and, although later cleared of the charges, he never returned to England. His work has influenced many other writers including Evelyn Waugh, Rudyard Kipling, J. K. Rowling, and John Le Carr?. P. G.

She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy of <em>Wolf Hall</em> along. --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em><p><b>Hilary Mantel</b> is the author of <i>Wolf Hall</i>, winner of the 2009 Man Booker Prize.

Compiled from his many sermons on "the saints' war against the devil," his exhaustive exposition of Ephesians 6:10-20 treats the spiritual battles of believers and their God-given protection.</p><p>Originally written in three volumes (1655-1662), the book first covers the Christian's call to arms and describes the nature of the battle and the character of our enemy. The various pieces of godly armor and weapons, and their use on offense and defense, are then described at length, item by item and verse by verse. More pastoral and practical than theological, Gurnall's work is filled with spiritual insight, encouraging exhortation, and inspiring word pictures concerning the importance of doctrinal truth as "a girdle for the mind," the power of holiness, the "pre-eminence of faith against other graces," and much more.</p><p>Profoundly biblical and as relevant today as it was almost 350 years ago, Gurnall's work is a resource that will add grace to the library of Calvinist and Arminian alike. This edition includes an introduction and biography of Gurnall by J.C. Ryle.</p></p><p>William Gurnall (1617-1679) pastored in the little town of Lavenham, in the English county of Suffolk. Despite his Puritan leanings, Gurnall signed the Act of Uniformity and agreed to the dictates of the Church of England. Though not ejected from his pulpit as were other non-conformists, his position was not respected on either side of the conflict. His massive treatise on spiritual warfare and two small pieces--The Christian&#39;s Labor and Reward and The Magistrate&#39;s Portrait Drawn from the Word-- comprise all of Gurnall&#39;s known published works.<p>Hendrickson's reprint of the 1865 Edinburgh edition of William Gurnall's "The Christian in Complete Armour " will be welcomed by all lovers of practical and pastoral divinity. Little is known about Gurnall, who was rector of Lavenham in Suffolk from 1644 until his death in 1679, and his reputation rests almost entirely on the "Complete Armour." The work itself originally appeared in three quarto volumes, published in 1655, 1658 and 1662 respectively, and consists of a long consecutive series of sermons preached at Lavenham on Ephesians 6:10-20. It was so popular that by the time of Gurnall's death it had already reached its 6th edition. However, while admired by such evangelical luminaries as Richard Baxter, Charles Haddon Spurgeon and John Newton, today it is little known.</p><p>The grand theme of the work is spiritual warfare and as the full title declares Gurnall's aim was to furnish the Christian with 'spiritual arms for the battle' against his Satanic foe. In its depth and scope the "Complete Armour" doubles as a body of practical divinity. The style is pictorial and 'affectionate' in the best Puritan tradition. Following a common template each section concludes with an application or 'use' intended to ground the received doctrine in the life of the believer - in Gurnall's own striking words to drive a nail hard into the conscience. Doctrinally the focus is Christological and Gurnall is emphatic that it is Christ himself who is the Christian's 'complete armour' and not his own merits or qualities. Throughout, his discussion is characterised by great psychological depth and he is assiduous in applying Scripture to diagnose and treat the believer's spiritual maladies.</p><p>His desire is for the believer's final perseverance in holiness and all the 'evangelical graces' until the 'evil day' of which Ephesians 6 speaks: their grapple with the 'last enemy' of death. His emphasis is therefore on the lived-out life of holiness as the fruit of the believer's righteousness in Christ and in this way he combines his Christology with a strong pneumatological thrust.</p><p>Hendrickson's are certainly to be congratulated for making this little-known work widely available. . . [I]t still very much retains the flavour of its nineteenth-century original. . . To ease the modern reader the Latin is helpfully translated and explanations of unusual dialect terms given. No other apparatus is provided but no other is strictly necessary.

His family&#x2019;s principal residence served as a gathering spot for London&#x2019;s ambitious merchants and gentlemen who dreamed of spreading their wealth and power and Christian faith beyond the boundaries of their small island nation. Smythe played such a central role in the city&#x2019;s leading overseas trading operations that he used the ground floor of his home for offices for the Levant, East India, and Muscovy Companies, and, most recently, the newly chartered Virginia Company. Upstairs he maintained a museum of sorts, displaying the exotic&#x2014;and, he no doubt hoped, enticing&#x2014;discoveries that mariners in his employ brought from the faraway voyages he helped finance. Captains who needed temporary housing between expeditions slept at the Symthe home. Sailors gathered there seeking jobs, and mariners&#x2019; wives sometimes boarded there while their husbands were at sea.1 <p></p>It was fitting that the architects of England&#x2019;s first empire congregated at Smythe&#x2019;s home. That rare combination of a bold dreamer and a tireless doer, Smythe was at the turn of the seventeenth century the most accomplished businessman in all of London. He served at one time or another as the principal leader of every important commercial enterprise in the city: the Levant, East India, and Muscovy Companies, the Merchant Adventurers, and the French and Spanish Companies. He helped fund expeditions to Ireland, explorations seeking a Northwest Passage, and even a voyage to Senegal. Renowned as a shrewd and supremely competent entrepreneur, Smythe was also respected as a decent and charitable man and a devout Christian. No one was better qualified to oversee the new company that King James chartered that April, the company that would bring about En gland&#x2019;s American empire.2 <p></p>By the time he involved himself in the Virginia Company, the forty- eight- year- old Smythe knew, from dearly bought experience, how to negotiate the diplomatic and .fiscal complexities of launching an overseas enterprise. Monarchs, no less than investors and mariners, had to be won over to the risky idea; exhaustive planning and shrewd promotion were required; lives and fortunes would almost surely be sacrificed before profits came. Overseas adventuring, then, was not for the faint of heart. <p></p>Thomas Smythe was the perfect man for the job, because challenges and setbacks&#x2014;inevitable in foreign trades&#x2014;did not deter him. Involved in creating the profitable Levant Company at the age of twenty- three, Smythe shortly became a very rich and important man in London. In the 1590s, he worked as a trade commissioner with the Dutch and helped fund the conquest of Ireland, and by 1600 he was an alderman and sheriff of London. But his friendship with the Earl of Essex and Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s suspicions of Smythe&#x2019;s participation with Essex in a failed coup led to his downfall. He was arrested in 1601, along with Essex and their mutual friend and William Shakespeare&#x2019;s principal patron, the Earl of Southampton, and locked in the Tower of London. Elizabeth&#x2019;s death in 1603 brought redemption. Elizabeth&#x2019;s successor, King James, pardoned Smythe, knighted him, and the following year appointed him ambassador to Russia.3 <p></p>In a matter of months, Smythe went from tower prisoner to the toast of Moscow. He was commissioned as ambassador in June 1604 and met the emperor in Moscow that October. Thousands of Russians lined the road as he headed into the city. He and his men rode in on horses adorned with "Gold, Pearle, and Precious Stone; and particularly, a great Chaine of plated Gold about his necke." Three emissaries of the emperor attended to Smythe&#x2019;s every need, assuring him "that if his Lordship wanted any thing, they all, or any one of them, were as commanded, so readie to obey therein." Smythe&#x2019;s delegation first saw the emperor "seated in a Chaire of Gold, richly embroidered with Persian Stuffe: in his right hand hee held a golden Scepter, a Crowne of pure Gold upon his head, a Coller of rich stones and Pearles about his necke, his outward Garments of Crimson Velvet, embroidered very faire, with Pearles, Precious Stones and Gold." While at court, they feasted on lavish meals served on silver and gold platters "piled up on one another by halfe dozens." Despite all this impressive pageantry, Smythe did not waste much time at his post. As soon as he secured additional special trading rights for the Muscovy Company, Smythe resigned and returned to London in September 1605. That fall he turned his attention across the Atlantic.4 <p></p>The London that Sir Thomas Smythe returned to in the fall of 1605 was a city for dreamers, with palaces and cathedrals every bit as awe inspiring as what he saw in Moscow. London was unequivocally the cultural and commercial center of the nation. As one visitor aptly put it, "London is not in En gland, but En gland in London."5 For the lucky few born to privilege, London offered a life of elegance and sophistication The new king&#x2019;s wife, Queen Anne, loved the arts and patronized musicians and poets and painters. She commissioned royal favorites such as Ben Jonson to stage elaborate court masques, and regularly entertained scores of velvet- clad gentlemen and their jewel- draped wives at pageants and lavish feasts at Whitehall Palace. The recently designed Gray&#x2019;s Inn Gardens, laid out by Sir Francis Bacon and using cuttings brought by Sir Walter Raleigh from America, provided the city&#x2019;s elites a setting at once majestic and bucolic for evening strolls. St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral, with the longest nave in all of Europe, stood at the western end of the city boundary, dominating the skyline. Young gentlemen in training studied law at the Middle Temple. Ornately carved wooden beams framed the main dining hall; light pouring in from stunning stained glass windows, then as now, would illuminate the serving table constructed from timbers taken from the Golden Hinde, the ship on which Sir Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe from 1577 to 1580. History, power, and ambition all resided in such places. The kind of men who lived in this part of London, not surprisingly, believed that the world could&#x2014;and even should&#x2014;be theirs.6 <p></p>But the real heart of London lay not in landmarks like the Middle Temple or Whitehall, but rather in the vigorous, ambitious, and youthful culture of the city. Some two hundred thousand people called London home at the turn of the seventeenth century. Despite exceedingly high mortality rates, the population had exploded during the Elizabethan era. Even as the plague swept the city in waves, immigrants kept coming: desperate and determined young people left the hinterlands of England to start over and find a different destiny in London. As the city grew, it remained decidedly youthful: a great proportion of citizens were under thirty.7 <p></p>London was still walled then, although its burgeoning population was pushing against the stone boundaries and spilling over into the "suburbs" outside the city proper and across the Thames. Within the city walls, what once had been open fields now bustled with carpenters&#x2019; shops and glass factories; former churchyards and abbeys became marketplaces. Streets were busy and dirty. Mud, garbage, and even human waste made crowded neighborhoods foul smelling and ripe for disease. And it was very loud: church bells clanged incessantly and wagons clattered along the city&#x2019;s crowded streets all day long, making "such a thundering as if the world ran upon wheels," and competing with the voices of peddlers hawking their wares and preachers giving open- air sermons.8 <p></p>Like the gentlemen who strolled through Gray&#x2019;s Inn Gardens and prayed in the front pews of St. Paul&#x2019;s, the working classes and impoverished newcomers&#x2014;the "rabble" of London&#x2014;also dreamed. Many wanted new opportunities, better lives, adventure. And London gave them the chance to remake themselves. Fifteen times larger than any other city in England, London offered its citizens anonymity and the economic opportunity to achieve more than their "place" would have otherwise allowed. Tudor- Stuart England was fairly obsessed with class: men were born to a status and there they would remain, whether tinker or king. Even a person&#x2019;s attire was supposed to conform to this rigid ranking, and sartorial laws made wearing the wrong fabric or color illegal. Elites successfully policed the social order in the countryside, where everyone knew everyone else, as well as among the coat of arms&#x2013;obsessed aristocracy in London. But the London street was another matter entirely: there, strangers could remake themselves and escape the rank they had been born to .ll. All that was required was a spirit of competitiveness, individualism, and daring.9 <p></p>London&#x2019;s culture reflected the ambitious, risk- taking youthfulness of its citizens. It was, as one resident aptly put it, "the Fair that lasts all year."10 Taverns, drunkenness, gambling, and violence were everywhere. At least a hundred bawdy houses and brothels operated in the suburbs of London, beyond the city walls or along the south bank. Bear- baiting was wildly popular. For this macabre spectacle, restrained bears were whipped, attacked by dogs, and sometimes gradually slaughtered before cheering crowds. Occasionally bears and bulls were baited together, and owners of the rings could heighten an animal&#x2019;s rage (and a crowd&#x2019;s plea sure) by attaching .reworks to its back. Another imaginative proprietor tied a monkey to a pony&#x2019;s back and then unleashed the dogs. One patron reported, "To see the animal kicking amongst the dogs, with the screams of the ape . . . is very laughable." Cockfights, boar fights, even horse- baiting drew paying customers eager to see the latest, bloodiest game in town. Sometimes they became surprise participants themselves, as did one unlucky spectator at a bull- baiting session: the bull gored a dog and tossed the bloody, dying animal onto her lap. City residents also watched football games and tennis and wrestling matches and frequented neighborhood fairs, where they could see puppet shows, street performers, and human "freaks" while drinking and gambling.11 <p></p>Meanwhile, the city&#x2019;s thriving press offered adventures for the mind. London was home to an active reading public with capacious tastes. Over a hundred publishers and an untold number of booksellers worked there, most within the shadow of St. Paul&#x2019;s. Stationers&#x2019; Hall, which licensed all books published within the city, sat just a few steps from the cathedral. And more than a dozen bookshops operated in St. Paul&#x2019;s churchyard, with sellers peddling sermons delivered there alongside travel stories that romanticized ocean voyages to foreign places, particularly the widely admired collections of Richard Hakluyt, and plays, including the works of the stage&#x2019;s greatest dreamer: William Shakespeare.12 <p></p>London was the kind of place where the son of a down- on- his- luck glover without a university education could, through talent and drive, become the most celebrated figure in all of literature. The city embraced and inspired Shakespeare, and he in turn entertained and moved its citizens. No man of the theater enjoyed more renown in Tudor- Stuart London than Shakespeare. He drew 1,500 to 2,000 paying customers a day to his theater, the Globe. Everyone in town enjoyed his work, from royals to the "rabble." Six days after his coronation, King James commissioned Shakespeare and his players to perform "for the recreation of our loving subjects" and recognized them as "the King&#x2019;s Men." For the next ten years they mounted plays at court on an average of fourteen times a year.13 <p></p>Shakespeare may have delighted much of London, but some found his work, to say nothing of his customers at the Globe, unseemly. Shakespeare&#x2019;s company attracted the so- called lesser sorts, and, in the eyes of some aristocrats and ministers, served up disgusting spectacles of violence and debauchery. It did not help that his play house was located in Southwark, a rather colorful neighborhood. Respectable gentlemen complained about the "vagrant and lewd persons" attending the Globe and the nearby bear- baiting rings and brothels. At St. Paul&#x2019;s Cross, an open-air pulpit just outside St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral, popular Protestant ministers such as William Crashaw and William Symonds railed against the craven, sinful playwrights and actors just across the Thames, putting them in the same category as the despised Roman Church. "Papists" and "players" were the enemies of "true" Christians&#x2014;Anglicans&#x2014;and were linked together in numerous sermons because of their skilled deceptiveness. By 1606, Crashaw and Symonds were promoting the founding of an American colony as the will of God and condemning the "papists" and "players" who opposed His mission.14 <p></p>This sort of anti- Catholic vitriol, decades in the making, was born out of both religious conviction and political intrigue. For nearly half a century preceding the founding of the Virginia colony, devout English Protestants increasingly viewed Catholics as a sinister element, spiritually bankrupt and dangerous to the nation. When the Protestant Queen Elizabeth acceded to the throne in 1558, she participated in the growing tendency of evangelical Protestants to link English Protestantism with national interest and view Catholics as their prime enemy. In 1568 Elizabeth imprisoned her Catholic cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom many Catholics believed to be the rightful sovereign of England. Mary&#x2019;s imprisonment so roiled her sympathizers that they embarked upon an unsuccessful rebellion against Queen Elizabeth in 1569. This marked the first of several attempts on Elizabeth&#x2019;s life by members of the persecuted Catholic community. In 1570, in the wake of the failure of this uprising and the continued incarceration of Mary, Pope Pius V excommunicated Elizabeth and freed English Catholics from any allegiance to her. While Pius hoped to destabilize the Elizabethan regime, he in fact rendered English Catholics traitors to their nation&#x2014;at least that was how the politically powerful Protestants saw things. By the 1580s, anyone attending Catholic mass could be imprisoned for a year; converting someone to Catholicism was high treason. Meanwhile, English Catholics in exile in Europe began secretly sending Jesuit missionaries to England to keep the faith alive and hopefully bring En gland back into the fold of the Roman Church. Like the plots against Elizabeth, these missionary efforts only confirmed in Protestants&#x2019; minds how dangerous and disloyal Catholics were.15 <p></p>The death of Elizabeth and accession of James in 1603 gave mo mentary hope of toleration to En gland&#x2019;s Catholics because the new king was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots. But shortly after James&#x2019;s coronation he ratified a law extending Elizabeth&#x2019;s policies regarding Catholics. A small group of Catholics, upset with James&#x2019;s failure to usher in changes, planned to kidnap the king, take over the Tower of London, and hold him captive there until he relented. That laughable folly was followed by a far more dangerous and plausible plot two years later. In the early hours of November 5, 1605, Guy Fawkes was arrested, bringing to light the Gunpowder Plot: an elaborate plan to blow up the House of Lords while the royal family was in attendance. Jesuit missionaries and their converts were quickly singled out as the perpetrators, and a raft of new anti- Catholic legislation sped through Parliament that year. Robert Cecil, the Earl of Salisbury and principal minister to King James (and soon to be an influential leader in the Virginia Company), was vehemently ant...</p><h2>The Decorated Page: Journals, Scrapbooks &amp; Albums Made Simply Beautiful</h2><p>&#x201c;Diehn opens up a new dimension&#x2014;the artist&#x2019;s vision of visual memories.

Offering a revolutionary new model of approaching the Bible, he frees those sacred scriptures from superstition, dogma, and tribalism, and in the process recovers their universal teaching on salvation and belief. Drawing on his personal experiences, including his Bible Belt upbringing, his years as a Buddhist monk, and his life as a father and husband in a small rural community, Strand makes even the most subtle spiritual teaching heartfelt and accessible. <i>How to Believe in God</i> illuminates a clear path to reclaiming a God that leaves nothing out and leaves no one behind. His open, gentle, pioneering approach to faith allows everyone&#x2014;from churchgoing Christians to those with no religious affiliation at all&#x2014;to experience the Bible in new and exciting ways.</p></p><p><p>CLARK STRAND is a spiritual teacher and the director of the Koans of the Bible Study Group, an ecumenical, interreligious spiritual community.

Is it the God who separates the saved from the damned, reserving bliss for the blessed, and brimstone for the nonbeliever? Or perhaps the narrow-minded God who resists new ways of thinking, the God who will brook no question and no discourse, the one who prefers the world the way it was before feminism or civil rights, before the discovery of evolution and quantum physics or the creation and collapse of stars? Is it the God who sponsors crusades, jihads,<br>and pogroms? Or maybe the one who tells a twenty-four-year-old man with a wife and three children to blow himself up in a crowded public square?<br><br>The list could go on and on. There&#x2019;s the God who created the world in six days.And then there&#x2019;s the one who puts a beautiful fruit tree within reach of his children, forbids them on pain of death to eat from it, then promptly disappears to some other part of the garden, keeping an eye peeled behind the bushes to see what they will do. There&#x2019;s the one with a rule for everything from menstruation to shellfish, who strikes people dead when they cross him. And then there&#x2019;s the one who kills Egyptian babies in order to save Jewish ones, then sends his only son to save all of mankind (so long as they are willing to become Christian). The Bible itself is filled with Gods we don&#x2019;t believe in. Or with ones who <i>shouldn&#x2019;t </i>be<br>believed in.<br><br>Where did these Gods come from, and what are we to do with them now that they are here? Is there any way to reform or reeducate them? Is there any way to get through to them with the message that the world is bigger and more inclusive now than in the days of desert and tribe? And if not&#x2014;if, as many modern atheists claim, the world is better off without them&#x2014;what, if anything, is there to replace them with? Are we destined to live with &#x201c;a God-shaped hole&#x201d; at the center of our being? However<br>many problems these troubled Gods created, those societies who succeeded in ousting them have hardly fared better. The loss of God in modern society has made totalitarianism in all its many forms, from communist to corporate, a virtual inevitability of modern life. True, the old God might have been a problem, but nonbelief doesn&#x2019;t seem to be an option. &#x201c;We are born believing,&#x201d; wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. &#x201c;A man bears beliefs as a tree bears apples.&#x201d; In the absence of God, human beings will always find <i>something </i>to believe in: science, progress, money, or just the ever-increasing power of the self.<br><br>So where does that leave us now?<br><br>Oddly enough, right where we started&#x2014;with the God of the Bible, as mysterious and difficult to account for as he is.<br><br>During the years I was working on this book, any number of people had occasion to ask me: Why the Bible? Why go back through all those plagues and rules? Why endure all the bloodletting and barbarism of an earlier, more primitive era&#x2014;an era when people thought demons caused diseases, women were unclean during their periods, and homosexuality was an abomination before God? Why not start over with a fresh slate and write about a God who <i>is </i>worth believing in? But the answer to those<br>questions, while surprising, was also very simple: because going back into the Bible is the same as going back into ourselves.<br><br>For most Westerners, God <i>lives </i>in the Bible. For better or worse, we can&#x2019;t change our idea of God without changing our ideas about the Bible first. And this is true for everyone in our society,whether they were raised in a religiously observant household or not. The Bible is the spiritual matrix of Western culture, the point of origin for all of our deepest beliefs and hopes and fears. It is the source of many of our laws and customs, not to mention many of our everyday expressions and the mind-set that comes along with them. It is the origin even of our ideas of time, from the seven days of the week to the &#x201c;beginning&#x201d; and the &#x201c;end&#x201d; of the world. You may not read it, or even know what it says, and still the Bible is inside of you. It&#x2019;s in the air we breathe, and it&#x2019;s in the culture at large. And therefore the idea of God is in us, too. There is no escaping it. <br><br>That was what I discovered in the end, and the reason I came back to the Bible in the effort to find a God I could believe in. And when I found that God, I discovered he&#x2019;d been there all along. Granted, I had to learn to read the Bible in a completely different way than it is read by most religious people.

It has become well known that Alchemy is a key which opens some of the deepest aspects of the Golden Dawn Tradition and provides the richest symbol system known to describe the spiritual process involved. It is apparent that those trusted with the development of the Ritual and Teachings of the Golden Dawn were intimately familiar with the deepest mysteries of Spiritual Alchemy. E. J. Langford Garstin, V. H. Frater A.e.F., was a Cancellarius of the Rosicrucian Order of the Alpha et Omega during the second quarter of the 20th century. His first book, &#x201c;Theurgy or The Hermetic Practice: A Treatise of Spiritual Alchemy&#x201d; has been recently published by IBIS Press and is recommended as a companion volume to his second book, &#x201c;The Secret Fire: An Alchemical Study&#x201d; now published by the Rosicrucian Order of the Golden Dawn. &#x201c;The Secret Fire&#x201d; begins the journey with the documentation of various instances in which the SECRET FIRE is described including the Bible and continues with the various words of the Alchemists and Rosicrucians leading up to one of the clearest unveilings of our SECRET FIRE found anywhere. Here is Alchemy, pure and simple.</p><p>"Edward Langford-Garstin was a chief of an A.O. Temple and well versed in alchemy as this book indicates. Garstin was the first A.O. Chief in the 1930s to discuss Chakras and their effect, and he brought them into the periphery of the Golden Dawn teachings through their alchemical links. The Alchemical teachings here concentrate on the spiritual aspect of the work, Book `M', the Philosophical Mercury of the Rosicrucian manifestos. This book is a must for all those studying the Golden Dawn, its roots, its history and its teachings." --Pat Zalewski, author of the highly acclaimed `The Magical Tarot of the Golden Dawn'<br><br>"In all honesty, Evola's "The Hermetic Tradition", and Garstin's " The secret Fire" have been and will ever remain my all time favorites.

Tristao Raposo, a nineteen-year-old black child of the Rio slums, and Isabel Leme, an eighteen-year-old upper-class white girl, meet on Copacabana Beach; their flight into marriage takes them to the farthest reaches of Brazil&#39;s wild west. Privation, violence, captivity, and reversals of fortune afflict them; his mother curses them, her father harries them with hirelings, and neither lover is absolutely faithful. Yet Tristao and Isabel hold to the faith that each is the other&#39;s fate for life, as they pass - in Shakespeare&#39;s phrase - &#34;through nature to eternity&#34;.

But what if you could enrich that bond even more? What if you could also listen -- and truly understand? What if your cat could reveal his mischievous secrets (not that he would) and your dog could tell you about her day? What if you could assure her you'd be back soon or assuage her fear of a visit to the vet? Would you like to know how to help her stop biting? Would you like to know why your show horse has stopped jumping? Would you like to know if your iguana is in pain? What if, when the time comes, you could say good-bye heart to heart?<br><br>You can. Amelia Kinkade, professional interspecies communicator, will show you how. In <b>Straight from the Horse's Mouth</b>, she shares the program she developed that has helped hundreds of her clients break through the only barrier that really separates people from any other animal: skepticism. Using guided meditations and other exercises in this book designed to increase intuition, you can literally learn to "talk with the animals," share memories and make plans, negotiate house rules or mediate sibling rivalries, diagnose illness, track a disappearance, accept one another's differences, and find each other again. Read Amelia Kinkade's adventures in animal communication in all their hilarity, passion, and tenderness, and know that you can join her. <br><br>Practice her exercises, and you will. Hear the chorus of troubled and endangered species, and learn what you can do to help. There will be no stopping the conversation.<br><br>Let <b>Straight from the Horse's Mouth</b> -- as practical as it is inspiring -- be your guide to better interspecies relationships, and it will change your life and your animal companions' lives too. That's our promise to you.</p><p>When an animal is truly a family member, you want to communicate with it as completely as you do with human members, but how? Amelia Kinkade is here to show you, with plenty of tools for direct and serious conversation with your four-legged friends. Foes of anthropomorphism, beware: if you don't assume that animals have similar emotional responses to ours, you're liable to find this book a bunch of hooey. Kinkade's techniques involve various methods of telepathy, from sending specific questions like "what's your favorite food?" to receiving emotions like sadness or joy. Her years of experience working with pet owners and rescue services give Kinkade a wealth of fascinating stories. Conversations relayed between unhappy animals and their humans can be instructive to an amazing point--one horse knew he needed an iron supplement, while a cancer-ridden dog apologized to his owner for being "such a burden." Simple ideas seem relatively easy to trade. When leaving for a weekend trip, it's easy to observe an agitated dog or kitty. Calmly relaying facts about how long you'll be gone and what she should expect while you're gone can go a long way toward solving everything from tummy upsets to malicious shredding of furniture. More advanced students of Kinkade's methods can visually find specific causes of pain in animals and listen to what they need from their humans to heal. As with other books on telepathy, you won't find research or studies here. But if you have an open mind and willingness to experiment, <i>Straight from the Horse's Mouth</i> can open up satisfying new dimensions in your relationships with all animals. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>Amelia Kinkade has been listed in The Top 100 Psychics in America. A full-time animal communicator, she is sought by veterinarians, animal rescue organizations, and animal lovers all over the world.

All the patterns are printed with transfer ink on special paper; complete instructions are included on how to transfer them easily. Unlike most commercial transfer patterns, which can rarely be used more than once, these patterns will reproduce clearly many times. Among the designs are many floral motifs -- realistic representations of marigolds, buttercups, etc., as well as semi-abstractions -- Pennsylvania Dutch motifs, realistic birds, baskets, etc. There are also many other designs including anchors, suns, butterflies, borders, a kitten in a shoe, a unicorn, and a beautiful forest scene. Most of the designs are from traditional Early American sources such as Godey&#39;s Lady&#39;s Book, Peterson&#39;s Magazine, and Suzanne Chapman&#39;s Early American Design Motifs. These designs can be used for crewel and embroidery or for decorating pillows, wall hangings, tablecloths, upholstery, and almost anything else you can think of which uses fabric. Because these designs have been brought together in one collection, you save much money. To accumulate comparable transfer patterns from magazines or other sources would cost you art least 20 times the price of this book.</p><p></p><h2>Cat Cross Their Graves: A Joe Grey Mystery (Joe Grey Mystery Series, 10)</h2><p><p>The beautiful, serene village of Molena Point, California is the type of place where people go to get away from the harsher realities of life&#x2013;&#x2013;which is what attracted classic film star Patty Rose to buy the village inn, and settle down to enjoy her golden years. But as the town gathers to celebrate and honor the beautiful, aging actress with a festival of her old films, Patty is brutally murdered&#x2013;&#x2013;to the horror and shock of this peaceful burg. </p><p> A gentle tortoiseshell cat, Kit, has been enjoying a retreat to the animal&#x2013;loving actress's inn, where she's spending time with her feline friends Dulcie, and the slick tomcat sleuth, Joe Grey. But her relaxation is cut short when she hears the gunshots that end Patty's life, and sees her dead body sprawled on the inn's front steps. She glimpses the killer racing into the parking garage, and soon follows his trail. </p><p> Joe and Dulcie must now follow the na�ve Kit's trail, and keep her from getting into serious trouble. To complicate matters, Joe discovers that Dulcie has been hiding a runaway child&#x2013;&#x2013;one of the lucky humans that these special cats choose to talk to&#x2013;&#x2013;who has now been kidnapped, likely by the same man who killed their famous friend. In the end, the little girl's abduction leads them to Patty's killer, and the feline friends are all united&#x2013;&#x2013;but they all must mourn a departed friend as they stand beside the newly laid grave of Patty Rose.</p></p><p><p>Shirley Rousseau Murphy is the author of twenty mysteries in the Joe Grey series, for which she has won the Cat Writers&#x2019; Association Muse Medallion nine years running, and has received ten national Cat Writers&#x2019; Association Awards for best novel of the year. She is also a noted children&#x2019;s book author, and has received five Council of Authors and Journalists Awards. She lives in Carmel, California, where she serves as full-time household help to two demanding feline ladies.</p>The beginning of Murphy's 10th Joe Grey mystery (after 2004's <i>Cat Fear No Evil</i>) signals that this won't be your typical light cat cozy ("On winter evenings the shadow of a tall, old house struck down across the graves like a long black arrow, and from the canyon below, errant winds sang to the small, dead children"). True, talking tomcat Joe Grey and his comrades, Dulcie and Kit, can squinch their furry paws to punch in 911 or phone in anonymous leads to Molena Point's police captain, Max Harper. These descendants of ancient sentient Celtic cats can also read forensics reports like <i>CSI</i> experts and interact with humans who guard their secret, but this time, such antics take a backseat to the gravity of the murder of local inn owner and retired screen star, Patty Rose, as well as the plight of Lori, a young runaway hiding in a library basement cubby hole, and the discovery of a child predator lurking in the California coastal town. A skilled YA author, Murphy handles such sensitive issues as child endangerment and death well. The large cast of characters may confuse new readers, but established fans will welcome back all their old friends, both feline and human. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Elf is a world-renowned pianist, glamorous, wealthy, happily married: she wants to die. Yoli is divorced, broke, sleeping with the wrong men: she desperately wants to keep her older sister alive. When Elf&#39;s latest suicide attempt leaves her hospitalised weeks before her highly anticipated world tour, Yoli is forced to confront the impossible question of whether it is better to let a loved one go.

Many of the research plans, still in operation, involve searching for a "violence gene," finding "biochemical imbalances," and intervening in the lives of schoolchildren with psychiatric drugs. </p><p>The Breggins describe this broad network of private and public programs--funded by the pharmaceutical industry as well as tax dollars--in the single-minded quest for a genetic or biological answer to the rising crime rate. </p><p>With several million youngsters already on Ritalin and other medications, diagnoses and treatments are replacing adult responsibility and social reform. The Breggins warn that the low priority of the rights and emotions of children is the real epidemic that must be addressed, and soon. </p><p>As an alternative, THE WAR AGAINST CHILDREN OF COLOR offers a host of measures for fulfilling the genuine needs of children without invasive treatments and stigmatizing labels.</p></p><p>Peter R.

This was not a farfetched request, since Washington, D.C.-like most American cities-is being overwhelmed with escalating violence. Casualties include children, like the four-year-old youngster who died after being hit by a bullet during a shooting spree on the playground of a local elementary school. It's no wonder that some African-American leaders, including columnist William Raspberry, have joined the mayor in wanting the National Guard deployed. Many have hoped that the problem of violence would remain an inner-city phenomenon. Commenting on the rash of tourist killings in southern Florida, columnist Amy Schwartz observed that "for all the statistics, it's been slow to sink in that this isn't just a problem for other people's neighborhoods." Raspberry put it more bluntly: "The cynics said we should just cool it. After all, it was mostly dope dealers killing each other. It would be over as soon as the turf claims got settled. Meanwhilewell, good riddance to bad rubbish." </p><p>Now horror stories of children killing or assaulting children can be found in every corner of America. If some of us in the suburbs feel relatively removed from drive-by shootings, we feel vulnerable to terrifying car-jackings and armed daylight robbery in our homes. </p><p>Individuals with means turn to security systems-from cumbersome steering wheel bars to elaborate electronic home security units. Communities beef up police forces and band together for neighborhood watches. Most tragically, children have begun carrying guns to school in order to protect themselves. </p><p>Almost everyone agrees that self-protective measures will not curb the overall violence, and that more arrests and mandatory minimum sentencing are creating new problems. Prisons are overflowing. The inmates are a mixed group ranging from the most violent perpetrators to those convicted for the sale of small amounts of street drugs, and their incarceration tends to make them into more hardened criminals. State legislators, under pressure from shrinking budgets and threatened state bankruptcies, are being forced to confront rising prison costs. </p><p>Now science and medicine have stepped forward to offer a helping hand. Some of the most prestigious and respected scientific institutions in our country are increasing their efforts in response to America's growing desperation. </p><p>Scientists and physicians are the miracle workers of our century, having provided everything from electric light against the darkness to a vaccine against polio. Their technical inventiveness seems capable of mastering the physical universe. In America we tend to hold them in high regard as impartial, humane, and, above all, objective. "Doctor-recommended" highlights many advertisements. We expect physicians and scientists to deal with facts-precise bits of physical evidence that are indisputable. </p><p>Against this background of expectations and beliefs, scientists and doctors are attempting to address violence as a disease: </p><p>The U.S. Public Health Service has launched a "public health campaign" against violence, focusing upon "vulnerable individuals." </p><p>* The most powerful psychiatrist in the federal government has publicly promoted the screening and preventive treatment of inner-city children-those with a presumed biological and genetic predisposition to become violent when they grow older. </p><p>* Federal agencies, foundations, and private industry are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the search for a biological basis for violent crime and antisocial behavior. Once it is found, drug treatments can be developed and administered to those who are biologically or genetically disposed to violence. </p><p>* Supporters of the federal Human Genome Project suggest that science is on the verge of locating genes that predispose people to everything from poverty and unemployment to alcoholism and crime. Anticipating such discoveries, the Human Genome Project has funded a conference called "Genetic Factors in Crime." </p><p>* Researchers and clinicians alike are frequently quoted in the media as citing "genetic predispositions" for every possible psychological and social problem, from inattentive behavior in school to alcoholism, schizophrenia, crime, and violence.The view that widespread violence can be best defined and treated as an individual disorder ignores other vast influences, including social, economic, educational, environmental and cultural differences in experience. The reduction of human experience to an expression of DNA or a wholly biological event shows an underlying bias and ideology-even though it is presented as objective research. </p><p>Even when an epidemic has an obvious physical cause, as exemplified by AIDS, science can have its limits, and identifying or treating vulnerable or diseased individuals may not offer the ultimate solution. Educating Americans to change their sexual values and habits, for example, may prove most effective in controlling the AIDS epidemic. But in the age of science, how many of us expect salvation to come from a combination of personal responsibility and transformed social viewpoints? The prevailing vision is that breakthroughs must happen in the laboratory. </p><p>Science and medicine influence our view of ourselves, and in turn science and medicine are influenced by our social prejudices. Scientific solutions are often laden with their own biases, such as an insensitivity to the value of liberty, and a moral vacancy around the rights and needs of children and minorities. </p><p>Resorting to the National Guard, as hazardous as it is, may be less menacing to civil liberties than resorting to the National Institute of Mental Health. If a neighborhood is secured and made safe for a time by a military presence and curfews, the curtailments of liberty are relatively easy to perceive. So are the limits of using military force to solve social problems. But the dangers of medical and psychiatric interventions-cloaked in science and the language of disease and healing-can be much more difficult to discern and to resist. Promises for ultimate success may be uncritically embraced by a public eager to find seemingly humane medical solutions. </p><p>The Faustian price for turning to the social-control doctors may not become fully apparent until the "cure" has been put into place. In our desperation to find answers, we could end up with measures that are ultimately more threatening than the street violence we all deplore, and to no avail as well. </p><p>A recently proposed federal violence initiative, which we have actively investigated and opposed, epitomizes this technological approach. Perpetrators of violence in the inner city are seen as biochemically and genetically defective, and plans are developed for identifying supposedly violence-prone children before they grow into dangerous youths and adults. </p><p>The violence initiative is the most recent example of a long series of attempts to resolve social conflict through science and technology. The controversy surrounding it illuminates the broader issue of the role of biomedicine in resolving social problems. </p><p>Is there validity to the science of social control? Do genetics and biochemistry play a role in crime and violence? Do pharmacological, or even psychosurgical, interventions hold any promise? </p><p>What is the history of biomedical social control, and is there precedent for fearing its wide-scale implementation in America? </p><p>How extensive were the government's recent plans for the violence initiative, and where do they stand after all the controversy? </p><p>What interest groups are supporting the doctors of social control? How involved is industry? The various mental health and research associations? Private foundations? The government? </p><p>What plans and projects remain in place, and what new ones loom on the horizon? </p><p>What groups are targeted by current proposals and ongoing programs? </p><p>How vulnerable are minorities? How extensive is the danger to all of America's children? </p><p>What can be done about the threat of biomedical social control-and what better alternatives are available? </p><p>The answers to these questions will affect the future of every American adult and child.</p></p><h2>Singing the Soul Back Home: Shamanism in Daily Life (Earth Quest)</h2><p>Offering advice on the application of simple shamanic principles to daily life, this book sets out to show how they can be learned by anyone, regardless of creed or religion.

Somewhere down the road there had to be payback for her perfect child-<p>&nbsp;</p><p>hood, her perfect career at the veterinary clinic, her perfect apartment in Minneapolis, her consistently perfect life. Friends who adored her envied her in equal measure, and secretly waited for the tragedy to come, because they believed in the law of averages and the irrefutable balance of good and bad in every life. And also because in the darkest moments of their own less than perfect lives, they just had to believe that someday Marla would get hers.</p><p>&#x201c;Good things come to good people,&#x201d; her father was fond of tell- ing her on those rare occasions when the shower of her good fortune made her feel just a little bit guilty. But if that were really true, why did the rest of the world believe the opposite? The notion that good- ness was punished was so pervasive that even the language was per- meated with warnings. Only the good die young. Nice guys finish last. No good deed goes unpunished. Phrases like that had often&nbsp;given Marla pause; made her think she should try harder to do some- thing bad occasionally, like forget to return a library book, just to even out the scales.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And then she&#x2019;d run over the bunny.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop crying, Marla. And stop calling it a bunny.It was just a goddamn rabbit.&#x201d; Her father had tried to comfort her with seman- tics.&#x201d; Probably the same one that ate every lick of my spinach plants last week. Every last lick.&#x201d;</p><p>But he hadn&#x2019;t known the worst of it, because she could never bring herself to say it aloud. The bunny hadn&#x2019;t died right away. She&#x2019;d seen it in her rearview mirror, trying to drag itself off the road with its front legs, because the hind legs wouldn&#x2019;t work. She&#x2019;d had to go back and run over it again.</p><p>It had been the right thing to do; but oh my God, that image in her rearview mirror would be with her to the end of her life, and although her father had felt great sympathy for her distress, he hadn&#x2019;t felt a bit for the rabbit. How could that be? How could you feel sorry for someone for being sad and not feel sorry for something being dead?</p><p>She spent the next week imagining that the bunny had been a nursing mother, and that somewhere baby bunnies were cold and mewling in a hidey-hole, slowly dying of starvation. She never admit- ted that to anyone, because people tended to think you were a bit unbalanced when you empathized with animals to the point of tor- ment. But empathy was the disease Marla had inherited from her mother, and there were no boundaries to it. She couldn&#x2019;t help con- necting to everyone and everything she encountered; she couldn&#x2019;t stop speculating about their lives, their families, their pain&#x2014;even that of silly rabbits that ate her father&#x2019;s entire spinach crop and then ran out in front of a speeding car.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Normally Marla didn&#x2019;t mind the night drive out to the farm, es- pecially on a Thursday, &nbsp;when the freeway was empty. Tomorrow night the frenetic weekend race to lake cabins would fill the two lanes heading out of Minneapolis with a jam of lights, white and red, crawling bumper-to-bumper for sixty miles before it started to thin out. But tonight, and every other summer weeknight, the road shot straight and true into deeper and deeper blackness where the exits were few and far between. Her exit, just three miles up, was what worried her. That particular two-lane road was one bunny shy this week, thanks to her, and she greatly feared a repeat of last week&#x2019;s carnage.</p><p>She took the ramp more slowly than usual, stopped at the top and spent a long time looking both ways before easing right onto the two-lane road. There was no moon tonight, and the darkness seemed to swallow the beams of her headlights, as if she were shining them down the throat of a monster. &nbsp;She slowed &nbsp;even further as she ap- proached the S curve through the woods where the bunny had once lived, and that was the only reason she didn&#x2019;t run right over the large black shape in the middle of the road.</p><p>As soon as her headlights hit the thing, she recognized it as one of those large plastic bags the volunteer crews used to pick up the occasional litter on road cleanup days. Still, it had startled her, and she could hear her heart pounding in her ears as she pulled over onto the shoulder and stopped. She sat there for a minute trying to catch her breath, her fingers still curled tight around the wheel, eyes wide and fixed on the bag.</p><p><i>Relax, Marla. Blink, for God&#x2019;s sake. It&#x2019;s not an animal, not a per- son; it&#x2019;s just a bag of trash. </i>Normally these bags were carefully placed on the shoulder for the township truck to collect, but this one was smack-dab in the middle of the two-lane road, and a genuine hazard</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>to any vehicle coming around the blind S curve at a normal rate of speed. It never occurred to her to simply drive around it and go on.</p><p>Her mind was already busy imagining a speeding car zipping around the first bend in the curve, slamming on the brakes, veering off the road and plowing head-on into a tree.</p><p>It was only after she got out of the car that she also imagined that same speeding car running into her while she was trying to drag the bag off the road, which made her move a lot faster.</p><p>It was surprisingly heavy, and it made a terrible scraping sound on the pebbly asphalt as she tugged and pulled it by inches toward the shoulder, and that was when she began to suspect what was re- ally in the bag. She released it with a little squeal and a shiver, and backed away.</p><p>Motorists killed more deer on this particular curve than all the hunters in the county managed to bring down during hunting sea- son. You didn&#x2019;t think much about what happened after the accidents unless you happened to see the roadkill crews making their rounds, loading grisly remains into the open-backed truck that hauled them away. Sometimes the job got messy, and then they had to use a shovel and a bag. Apparently this particular bag had fallen unnoticed off the back of the truck when it accelerated on the curve.</p><p>Marla looked down at the bag with a mixture of sadness and distaste, understanding the heaviness now, seeing the telltale swells and lumps that clearly marked a large object and not a collection of discarded cans and paper. At least she hadn&#x2019;t killed this one; hadn&#x2019;t witnessed its violent end, which made the job ahead a little easier. She wondered absently why it didn&#x2019;t smell, murmured a brief prayer that the bag didn&#x2019;t rip when she tried moving it again, then bent to her work.</p><p>This time she put her back to the side of the road and tried pull-</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ing the bag toward her. The large animal inside shifted and rolled with the first tug. Marla winced, but kept at it, right up until the moment the bag snagged on a sharp piece of broken asphalt, tore open, and a bloody human arm fell out.</p><p>Marla snapped upright and stifled a choked &nbsp;gasp. For a minute her mind didn&#x2019;t work at all, and then when it started up again it manufactured terrible pictures. Not that there was a dead person in that bag, because that was a reality she just couldn&#x2019;t accept at the moment. What occurred to her instead was that in the movies, just when the heroine thought she was safe, the supposedly dead per- son&#x2019;s hand jerked out and grabbed her ankle.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh God, oh God, oh God.&#x201d; She began to back very, very care- fully away, toward her car, keeping her eyes focused on the inky blackness of the road ahead, because she didn&#x2019;t dare look down at the bag again.</p><p>And then suddenly, twin white lights pierced the darkness and began rolling toward her, faster and faster. Too small for headlights. They&#x2019;re reverse lights. Dear Jesus, there was &nbsp;a truck up there, so close, and she&#x2019;d never even seen it. And now it was coming for her.</p><p>Marla was totally paralyzed for a few moments, trying to regain her composure, rationalizing for the sake of her sanity, because none of this made sense in her perfect world.</p><p><i>The truck is not coming </i>for <i>you, it&#x2019;s coming to </i>help <i>you. This is the country&#x2014;people stop to offer assistance when they see a car on the side of the road, because in Buttonwillow, &nbsp;Minnesota, everybody is your neighbor, even if you live twenty &nbsp;miles apart. It&#x2019;s probably somebody you know, maybe even somebody you went to grade school with. And there&#x2019;s &nbsp;a perfectly reasonable explanation for that body in the trash bag. . . .</i></p><p>Marla snapped back to reality. No, no, no, there wasn&#x2019;t. There</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>was no perfectly reasonable explanation on God&#x2019;s green Earth for a dead body in a trash bag in the middle of a deserted country road. No perfectly reasonable explanation for this truck, suddenly appear- ing out of nowhere. And now, because she&#x2019;d been thinking too much again, it was too late to duck into the safety of her car and screech away. Too late to call 911 or Jacob, because the truck had rolled to a stop a few feet in front of her car and now the driver&#x2019;s door was slowly creaking open. At that point, she abandoned all thought, suc- cumbed to panic and instinct, and bolted into the woods.</p><p>Every inch of her felt like it was on fire as she leapt through the brush and bramble, dodging trees in the darkness, clambering over fallen logs, &nbsp;tripping &nbsp;over exposed roots &nbsp;and scrambling &nbsp;back to her feet. She knew these woods&#x2014;Cutter Creek was to her right, and a few hundred yards up ahead there was a clearing and then Hank Schifsky&#x2019;s cornfield. Another quarter of a mile up was his long dirt driveway and his old farmhouse. She could make it.</p><p>And then she felt herself falling, felt her ankle give way &nbsp;as she tumbled down a steep, washed-out gully that hadn&#x2019;t existed when she&#x2019;d run wild in these woods as a kid.</p><p>She choked back whimpers of fear and pain and dragged herself to the base of a large oak tree, trying to make herself as small as pos- sible. And as stupid as it was, she hadn&#x2019;t lost hope; she was still wait- ing to hear the call of a friendly voice behind her. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am? Ma&#x2019;am! Don&#x2019;t run, I&#x2019;m here to help you!&#x201d;</p><p>But all she heard was relentless, crashing footsteps in the woods behind her. The raspy pant of her pursuer.</p><p>Something switched off inside her. She divorced herself from her immediate reality, from her physical being, and retreated deep into the core of her soul. There it was peaceful, a place where she could</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>think of her past and her future. She should have married Jacob. And if he&#x2019;d still have her, she&#x2019;d do just that. They&#x2019;d have babies and live in Buttonwillow until the end of their days. They should have done it a long time ago, back when they were both eighteen and Jacob had given her the promise ring she still wore on her right ring finger, even though she was a grown woman.</p><p>The footsteps were getting closer now, crunching through the dead branches and old, dried leaves that littered the forest floor. Things couldn&#x2019;t end here. She had to leave something so Jacob and her father would know she&#x2019;d been here, had made it this far, and could maybe piece together what had happened if she didn&#x2019;t make it out of these woods alive.</p><p>She pulled the ring off her finger and placed it by the base of the tree where she was hiding, and as she heard the labored breathing getting louder, she got up and started running on her swollen, ru-</p><p>ined ankle, screaming at the top of her lungs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p> he lights were what Walt would always remember. They didn&#x2019;t belong in this dark night in the countryside. They lit up the<p>&nbsp;</p><p>thick woods on the north side of the narrow road, throwing spooky shadows through the tightly packed tree trunks and brush.</p><p>They shed unwelcome light on the north side, where there was a turnaround with space enough for one car to park, for the daring anglers who skidded down the treacherous slope to drop their lines in the creek below. You fished at night during the few weeks when the suckers were running, but for the rest of the summer, only kids parked there at night to kiss and hold hands, and sometimes more than that, before the clock ticked to curfew.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The turnaround had been there as long as Walt had been alive. He&#x2019;d parked there with Mary, his high school sweetheart, before sneaking &nbsp;back home, and he&#x2019;d proposed to her there, too. Right there, where the path down to the creek carved a hole in a stand of cottonwoods far older than he was now.</p><p>All these things belonged here, had always been here, but not the lights, &nbsp;and yet &nbsp;tonight they were everywhere, &nbsp;startling the early spring frogs into silence, as if the whole place had been swept clean of night creatures.</p><p>Marla&#x2019;s car, the white Ford Explorer he&#x2019;d bought for her when she graduated from college, was sitting in the turnaround, visiting the very spot where she might have been conceived all those years ago. It was spotting from the gentle April rain that had just started to fall, and Walt&#x2019;s eyes brushed over it as if it wasn&#x2019;t there, because it shouldn&#x2019;t be.</p><p>He had been standing here so long while the Highway Patrol set up the lights and county deputies paced the grounds. He was glad the Highway Patrol was here. The more departments, the better. It gave the scene, the tragedy, a level of import that promised careful attention.</p><p>The crime-scene techs, who looked like astronauts in their white suits and booties, hurried to cover that dreadful, bloody place in the middle of the road that was surrounded by blinking red lights and peppered with iridescent yellow crime-scene markers. One of the techs, who had known Walt since he&#x2019;d worked for him baling hay as a high schooler, looked over his shoulder at the old man.</p><p>&#x201c;Probably isn&#x2019;t human blood at all,&#x201d; he said with a fake, forced shrug. &#x201c;Raccoon, squirrel, deer more than likely.&#x201d;</p><p>Walt didn&#x2019;t move. He kept looking at the plastic now covering</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>the blood, protecting it from the rain.&#x201d;Marla hit a rabbit last week on this very road,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Could have been a rabbit,&#x201d; the tech said, but it was too damn much blood for anything that small and he knew it.</p><p>Marla had been missing for only a few hours, but out here, there were no time limits on reporting a missing person. This was Marla. They all knew her, like they knew every person in their district, and they knew she would have called her dad if she was going to be late for dinner.</p><p>A deputy approached Walt and tipped his brown plastic-covered hat. &#x201c;Mr. Gustafson, is that Marla&#x2019;s vehicle?&#x201d;</p><p>Walt hesitated because no one ever called him Mr. Gustafson. &#x201c;It is.&#x201d;</p><p>The deputy sighed and looked down. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find her, sir. Don&#x2019;t you worry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Appreciate it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacob was here, too, coming out of the woods now, his face a frozen, unreadable mask. He&#x2019;d been the first to arrive, getting here so soon after Walt had phoned him that he worried about how fast the boy had been driving, and how carelessly. He&#x2019;d been sweet on Marla d...</p></p><h2>Marrying Off Mother: And Other Stories</h2><p>A collection of short stories by a world-renowned naturalist and author of <i>My Family and Other Animals</i> introduces an eccentric cast of characters including a prize-truffling pig in France and an aging Memphis belle.</p><p>Beginning with Esmeralda, a champion truffle pig who smells of Joy, this collection of eight stories finds Durrell on a familiar anecdotal high. Fact or fiction, his tales are full of the unique tricks and deftly timed scenes that characterize his other writings, from the nun who finds her truer calling in a Monte Carlo casino to the beloved cruise captain who drops dead as his ship crosses the dateline. But, memorable as they are, the manner of their introduction has more enduring appeal. With his natural storytelling rhythm and sunny, generous stance, Durrell not only pins down the precise idiosyncrasies of his unlikely subjects (the devoted Greek friend who swears ``My lips are seals'') but validates them as well, allowing, for example, the former hangman rattled by his past to confront the men he executed before determining his own death. In the title story, Gerry and his siblings at a younger age, endowed with the same dubious qualities they've had in previous appearances, try to arrange a wildly inappropriate match for their widowed mother; she responds with a vastly superior scheme of her own. In another piece, a perpetually cursing parrot inadvertently hastens the downfall of a wayward vicar. On two legs or four, these improbable creatures offer softened charms and certain satisfactions for old fans and newer enthusiasts. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In these eight stories, which feature the author himself, naturalist Durrell contrasts human and animal behavior. The entire collection is prefaced by an epigram from Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary : "Bride--a woman with a fine prospect of happiness behind her." The reader soon finds the same prospect, for the epigram's minimal relevance indicates the problem: Durrell does not seem to know when he has made his point. The title story shows how the author's widowed mother cleverly stops her meddlesome children from trying to get her remarried. "Retirement" aims for profundity with the sudden death of a retiring sea captain but becomes silly. "The Jury," about a hangman in Paraguay haunted by his victims, has potential but grows tired and predictable. There are many wonderfully descriptive passages and images, but they ramble. A valiant effort drowned by purple prose.

In this new Ancient-Future series book, Bob Webber evaluates this common misunderstanding of spirituality as separated from God's story, extremely self-focused, and shaped by our surrounding culture. This challenging work offers a corrective, calling us to an alternative Christian spirituality, one that reveals two sides-that of God's "divine embrace" of us and our passionate response. <i>The Divine Embrace</i> is a fresh, grounded look at true spirituality that will be embraced by pastors, thinking Christians, and anyone looking for an engaging and thorough treatment of this topic.</p><p>Learn to live out true Christian spirituality in today's world<br><br>In The Divine Embrace, part of his acclaimed Ancient-Future series, Robert Webber lays the foundation for understanding Christian spirituality by tracing it from the ancient church to the present, showing how biblical teaching has been developed theologically and informed by changes in culture. He then explores how we can return contemporary spirituality to its biblical source, living out God's story in our individual lives and in our life together as the church. You will be encouraged and equipped to live out your spirituality as a deeper and more delightful response to God's divine embrace.<br>"Robert Webber's new book places him in the good company of Dallas Willard, Richard Foster, and Eugene Peterson as one of our most important thinkers about spiritual formation for authentic Christian living. It provides fresh, wise, and challenging guidance that is rooted in a career of Christian leadership development. It draws from decades of research in church history and spirituality, and flows from the mind of a scholar and the heart of a practitioner.

The five-act play&#x2014;the story of an incognito king whose love for the wife of a banished revolutionary brings on the chaos the king has fought to prevent&#x2014;was never published in Nabokov&#x2019;s lifetime and lay in manuscript until it appeared in a Russian literary journal in 1997. It is an astonishingly precocious work, in exquisite verse, touching for the first time on what would become this great writer&#x2019;s major themes: intense sexual desire and jealousy, the elusiveness of happiness, the power of the imagination, and the eternal battle between truth and fantasy. The play is Nabokov&#x2019;s major response to the Russian Revolution, which he had lived through, but it approaches the events of 1917 above all through the prism of Shakespearean tragedy.<br></p></p><p><p>Vladimir Nabokov studied French and Russian literature at Trinity College, Cambridge, then lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym Sirin. In 1940, he left France for the United States, where he wrote some of his greatest works&#x2013;&#x2013;<i>Bend Sinister</i> (1947),<i> Lolita</i> (1955), <i>Pnin </i>(1957), and <i>Pale Fire</i> (1962)&#x2013;&#x2013;and translated his earlier Russian novels into English. He taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell.

She is the great-great-great-granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy.<br></p><i>Excerpted from the Hardcover Edition<br></i><b>Introduction<br></b><br>The Tragedy of Mister Morn was Vladimir Nabokov&#x2019;s first major work, and the laboratory in which he discovered and tested many of the themes he would subsequently develop in the next fifty-odd years: the elusiveness of happiness; the creative and destructive playfulness of the imagination; courage, cowardice, and loyalty; the truth of masks; the struggle of freedom and order for possession of the soul; the sovereignty of desire and illicit passion; and what one character calls &#x2018;that likeness which exists / between truth and high fantasy&#x2019; (I.ii.59&#x2013;60), a likeness under whose inspiration Nabokov would take reality, fancy, art, and impossibility, and twist them together into the four-dimensional knots of Lolita, Pale Fire, and his other great novels.<br><br>Yet Morn, which Nabokov wrote in Prague in the winter of 1923 to 1924, when he was only twenty-four years old, was never performed or published in his lifetime, though several readings of the play did take place in Berlin, then Nabokov&#x2019;s home, in the spring of 1923. The opportunities in Berlin for staging a Russian play by a nearly unknown writer were limited, and publication cannot have seemed financially attractive to the �migr� publishing houses that would later print Nabokov&#x2019;s novels. In America, and then in Switzerland, Nabokov translated most of his Russian fiction, but not his early plays, and when he died, in 1977, the typescript and fair copy of Morn still lay dormant in his �personal archive in Montreux. Then, in 1997, Zvezda, a Russian literary journal, published the complete Russian text of Morn; and in 2008 the play finally became available to a wider (Russian-reading) audience when a revised version of the text was published in book form by Azbuka Press of St Petersburg. These publications have in turn made possible this current edition &#x2013; the first translation of Morn into English.<br><br>While Morn is in many respects the seedbed for Nabokov&#x2019;s major novels, there are also elements in it which are fascinatingly unlike anything in his later work, and which reflect issues in Nabokov&#x2019;s life at the time of writing. Most prominent of these is revolution. Nabokov came from a distinguished liberal family in St Petersburg: his father, V. D. Nabokov, had been one of the ministers in the short-lived Kerensky government which ruled between the fall of the Tsar and the ascent to power of Lenin and the Bolsheviks in 1917. That year, the Nabokov family fled St Petersburg, first for Yalta, then for London, and, eventually, Berlin &#x2013; where the young Nabokov would rejoin them in 1922, after completing his degree at Cambridge. Even in Berlin, however, the Nabokov family was not safe from the extremist ideologies of right and left which had vied for power in Russia after the failure of the liberal centre, and on 28 March 1922 Nabokov&#x2019;s father was shot dead by a Monarchist assassin who was in fact aiming not at him but at another �migr� politician.<br><br>Nabokov&#x2019;s hatred of the Soviet regime is directly expressed in much of his writing, most prominently his novels Invitation to a Beheading (1935/6) and Bend Sinister (1947). But he would never again write anywhere nearly so directly about the moment of revolution itself, or so probingly about ideology, as he did in Morn. In the play&#x2019;s two main revolutionaries, Tremens and Klian, Nabokov depicts a politics and poetics of nihilism which, it is implied, was the driving force behind the Russian Revolution. In this Nabokov was refining a critique of revolutionary ideology which can be traced back as far as Turgenev&#x2019;s Fathers and Sons (1862) and Dostoevsky&#x2019;s The Possessed (1872). He would articulate this critique again in his last, and greatest, Russian novel, The Gift (1937/8), whose fourth chapter is a mocking biography of Nikolai Chernyshevsky &#x2013; the revolutionary thinker of the 1860s who was the object of Turgenev&#x2019;s and Dostoevsky&#x2019;s conservative critiques, and would become Lenin&#x2019;s hero. But in Morn Nabokov explores more fully and explicitly than he ever would again what he saw as the origins of the revolutionary impulse in a death-instinct and passion for destruction. When Ganus, who had once been a revolutionary, returns from exile and discovers the happiness that the masked King has brought to the kingdom, he asks Tremens why he is not now satisfied. Tremens pours scorn on him. Neither happiness nor equality is Tremens&#x2019;s purpose, he explains; rather, he is seeking to imitate the violent destructiveness of life itself, which &#x2018;rushes headlong / into ash, [and] destroys everything in its way&#x2019; (I.i.287&#x2013;8). &#x2018;Everything,&#x2019; Tremens explains, &#x2018;is destruction. And / the faster it is, the sweeter, the sweeter . . .&#x2019; (I.i.295&#x2013;6). To him, this destruction is beauty:<br><br>Did you see,<br><br>one windy night, by moonlight, the shadows<br><br>of ruins? That is the ultimate beauty &#x2013;<br><br>and towards it I lead the world.<br><br>(I.i.267&#x2013;70)<br><br>Tremens cites as one aspect of that destructiveness the sexual drive itself, in the figure of &#x2018;the maiden, who prays for the blow of a man&#x2019;s love&#x2019; (I.i.294), and one distinctive quality of the play is an unblushing erotic candour to which Nabokov would not fully return until Lolita (1955). Thus Klian, the violent-minded revolutionary poet who serves as Tremens&#x2019;s factotum, tells his fianc�e Ella that<br><br> . . . To enter you, oh, to enter,<br><br>would be like entering a tight and searing<br><br>sheath, to gaze into your blood, to break<br><br>through your bones, to learn, to grasp, to touch,<br><br>to press your being in between my palms! . . .<br><br> (I.ii.122&#x2013;6)<br><br>This anticipates Humbert Humbert in Chapter 2, Part Two of Lolita saying that &#x2018;my only grudge against nature was that I could not turn my Lolita inside out and apply voracious lips to her young matrix, her unknown heart, her nacreous liver, the sea-grapes of her lungs, her comely twin kidneys.&#x2019; Yet, as with so many aspects of the play, in the sphere of desire Nabokov explores opposite poles of experience. Against Klian&#x2019;s dark vision of sexual appetite is set a more salubrious expression of love&#x2019;s idealizing power &#x2013; in the faith that Midia, and the other citizens, place in Morn&#x2019;s nearly magical beneficence, and in Ella&#x2019;s idea of love as a force that coalesces experience:<br><br> . . . all is one: my love and the raw sun,<br><br>your pale face and the bright trickling icicles<br><br>beneath the roof, the amber spot upon<br><br>the porous sugary snow mound, the raw sun<br><br>and my love, my love . . .<br><br> (III.ii.190&#x2013;94)<br><br>This, and the tenderly specific attention paid to the minutiae of Ella&#x2019;s hair, clothes, and make-up, seem to attest to the fact that Nabokov wrote Morn soon after meeting and falling in love with V�ra Slonim, who would become his wife &#x2013; and the play&#x2019;s typist. With her girlishness, humour, and idealism, Ella ranks alongside Lolita as one of Nabokov&#x2019;s few fully realized female characters.<br><br>If, in its treatment of revolutionary ideology, death, and desire, Morn shows us elements that Nabokov would not develop again, or not for a long time, there is one respect in which it stands very obviously as the source of Nabokov&#x2019;s immediately subsequent writing, and this is in its exploration of the twin themes of happiness and make-believe. In 1924, Nabokov would begin writing his first novel, Happiness. The novel was aborted and its drafts are now lost, but there is no question that its title expresses one of the central themes of Nabokov&#x2019;s oeuvre, in which happiness is a mysterious variable, &#x2018;the zany of its own mortality&#x2019;, as Sebastian Knight calls it, no sooner found than lost, but always something much more profound than anything &#x2018;happiness&#x2019; means in modern use, where it merely names the mirage evoked by the goals we set ourselves. As for make-believe, it is central to Nabokov&#x2019;s work that any reality worth caring about is one freshly imagined, that, as he puts it in Strong Opinions (1973), &#x2018;average reality begins to rot and stink as soon as the act of individual creation ceases to animate a subjectively perceived texture&#x2019;, and therefore that, as Vadim&#x2019;s aunt tells him in Chapter 2 of Nabokov&#x2019;s final complete novel, Look at the Harlequins! (1974), it is a fundamental imperative for every person that in art and life he should &#x2018;Play! Invent the world! Create it!&#x2019; The theme of make-believe also links Morn to two other verse-plays which Nabokov had written in 1923 before embarking on Morn, the one-act closet dramas Death and The Pole, which together mark out the two poles between which Morn moves: in the first, a cynical intellectual related in mentality to Tremens presses the view of illusion as arrant deceit; while the second heroizes Captain Scott, the quixotic Antarctic explorer, a Morn-like figure whose steadfast courage inspires and sustains his followers, who always seems to be playing, even in the face of death, and who is, like Morn, recognized by his laughter.<br><br>In Morn Nabokov gave these themes a political significance more explicit than any we find in his later work. Against the revolutionary politics, grounded in the ideals of equality, sameness, and even death, that Tremens and Klian embody, Nabokov postulates a conservative politics, animated by an ideal of happiness. As Morn says, he<br><br>. . . created<br><br>an age of happiness, an age of harmony . . . God,<br><br>give me strength . . . Playfully, lightly I ruled;<br><br>I appeared in a black mask in the ringing hall,<br><br>before my cold, decrepit senators . . . masterfully<br><br>I revived them &#x2013; and left again, laughing . . .<br><br> (III.i.131&#x2013;6)<br><br>Morn&#x2019;s example has aestheticized the world, restoring order by turning it into a fairy tale or a play: if even the King is an actor, then all identity is not something sovereign but something performed, and he shows people how to act as they would wish to be. He is a fantasy of the Foreigner, a mysterious figure who enters at the beginning and the end of the play and comes from the real world of revolutionary Russia:<br><br>. . . In our country all is not well,<br><br>not well . . . When I wake up, I will tell them<br><br>what a magnificent king I dreamt of . . .<br><br> (V.ii.98&#x2013;100)<br><br>The implicit argument of Morn is that for the sake of order, �morality, and happiness in the real world, people must make-believe in the possibility of an ideal world. The play takes place in an imaginary kingdom repeatedly described as having the air of a skazka or fairy tale. In a synopsis of the play, Nabokov described this atmosphere as &#x2018;neoromanticism&#x2019;, saying that the setting of the play took &#x2018;something from the 18th Century Venice of Casanova and from the 30s [the 1830s] of the Petersburg epoch&#x2019;. It also borrows from Shakespeare, for in Morn, as in Shakespeare&#x2019;s history plays such as Richard III, the state is, necessarily, a play or pageant; a secret passage leads from the throne-room to the theatre. This is one of the many details that Nabokov would reuse nearly forty years later in his most metafictive work, Pale Fire (1962), in which an imaginary poet and imaginary king conjure with each other&#x2019;s existences. Kinbote, the imaginary King of Zembla, or semblance, may have assassinated Shade, the imaginary poet, just as in Morn Tremens says: &#x2018;it&#x2019;s a shame, Dandilio, that the imaginary / thief did not destroy the made-up king!&#x2019; (V.i.188&#x2013;9). But in Morn, as later in Pale Fire, this kingdom of imagination is all too precarious: Tremens is determined to unmask Morn&#x2019;s happy reign of make-believe as a cynical fraud, and to tear down the civic order it supports. He succeeds in doing so, until a false rumour that Morn fled for love, not cowardice, reignites the romanticism of the people. It is to defend that illusion that Morn, ultimately, must kill himself.<br><br>This idea of kingship as theatre, or as a work of imagination, is one of the many respects in which Morn is indebted to Shakespeare. The heavy crown is a symbol of the burdensomeness of power, as it is in Shakespeare&#x2019;s history plays, such as Henry IV, Part 2, towards the end of which Prince Henry stares uneasily at the crown lying on his dying father&#x2019;s pillow, &#x2018;so troublesome a bedfellow&#x2019;, which, he says, &#x2018;dost pinch thy bearer&#x2019;, and &#x2018;dost sit / Like a rich armour worn in heat of day, / That scalds with safety&#x2019; (IV.v.22, 29&#x2013;31). In Morn, too, the &#x2018;fiery crown&#x2019; burns and squeezes with &#x2018;its diamond pain&#x2019;, and Morn complains that<br><br>. . . The stupefied mob<br><br>does not know that the knight&#x2019;s body is dark<br><br>and sweaty, locked in its fairy tale armour . . .<br><br> (V.ii.124&#x2013;6)<br><br>From Shakespeare, too, Nabokov drew a series of metaphors for civic order which could be deployed to warn against the rash alterations of Bolshevism. The kingdom is like the human body, so that Tremens&#x2019;s fever symbolizes the convulsions he wishes upon the state, as, again, in Henry IV, Part 2, where the Archbishop of York declares that<br><br>. . . we are all diseased,<br><br>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours<br><br>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,<br><br>And we must bleed for it.<br><br> (IV.i.54&#x2013;7)<br><br>Or the kingdom is like music, as Ganus argues when he says that &#x2018;The power of the King / is living and harmonious, it moves me now / like music&#x2019; (I.i.231&#x2013;3), echoing an idea most famously expressed in a speech given by Ulysses in Shakespeare&#x2019;s Troilus and Cressida. The same idea is implicit in The Tempest, a play with which Morn is associated through the kinship between Prospero and Morn, both of them magician-kings. But the Shakespeare play most obviously linked to Morn is Othello: Ella dresses Ganus up as Othello so that he can visit Midia unobserved, and she twice quotes the lines Desdemona utters when Othello is about to smother her (the first time slightly misquoting them). The Tragedy of Mister Morn is less concerned with doubling, and with the duality of human nature, than Nabokov&#x2019;s later works. But here already, it is clear that when Ganus wears Othello&#x2019;s face, he discovers in himself a shadow side, a dark jealousy like that which blackened and distorted Othello. Conversely, Morn, by wearing a mask, becomes a nameless sovereign, King X, as Nabokov calls him in the synopsis, the variable upon which a lucky people can project their fantasies of happiness and order; and when he is unmasked by his cowardice, he betrays not only the ideals of his people and his own self-respect but even the identity and integrity he had once seen when he gazed into the healing silver of the mirror.<br><br>But in Morn Nabokov was trying to emulate Shakespeare not only at the level of image and symbol, but also of character and drama, register and rhythm. The simplest expression of this is that Morn is written in the iambic pentameter of Shakespearean tragedy, though Nabokov is more strictly regular in his rhythmic patterns than Shakespeare. Though Morn&#x2019;s prosody alludes to Shakespeare, it does so through the mediation of Pushkin&#x2019;s &#x2018;little tragedies&#x2019; (all written in 1830, the most famous of which is Mozart and Salieri). More specifically Shakespearean &#x2013; and �un-Pushkinian &#x2013; is the language of Morn, which, especially in the philosophic speeches of Tremens, Klian, Morn and Dandilio, is densely metaphorical and highly compressed in the manner of late Shakespeare. So Morn, saying farewell to Midia, justifies the aberrations of fate by comparing life to music, before suddenly shifting the already difficult metaphor into another key, comparing the music of existence to the structure of a building whose details can detract from an appreciation of its overall harmony:<br><br>But, you see &#x2013; the moulded whimsy of a frieze<br><br>on a portico keeps us from recognizing,<br><br>sometimes, the symmetry of the whole . . .<br><br> (IV.235&#x2013;7)</p><h2>Punisher Max: The Platoon</h2><p>By the time the Punisher was born in Vietnam, Frank Castle had already become a dark legend of the battlefield.

A native of Minneapolis, he lives near Austin, Texas.</p><br>&nbsp;<br>The first time I saw the tiassa was nine Real Years before I was born. Mafenyi was holding it, and it was so pretty! When I saw it again, two hundred Real Years earlier, I had to take it so I did.<br>I didn&#x2019;t think Mafenyi would mind too much. She hadn&#x2019;t made it to keep. She told me that she made it because she had to, but it shouldn&#x2019;t ever stay with anyone for too long. She used silver that came all the way from Aelma, which is a city on the Chareq River near some mountains called Daeld, which is where the silver was found in the ground.<br>Mafenyi said she melted the silver in a cauldron made of light, and she cut off her hand and put it in the cauldron, and plucked out one of her eyes and put that in, too, and then shaped it while it was still hotter than hot. She worked on it for years and years, so the ears would be so perfect, and you could see candlelight through the wings; she put tiny sapphires in for the eyes. I asked her how come she still had both hands and both eyes, and she said she was a Goddess and so she grew them back. She said I could be a Goddess if I wanted to be, and I said my grandmother was a Goddess and it didn&#x2019;t seem like much fun.<br>When we were done talking I went away, but then I came back. I wanted to just look at it some more, but she was sleeping, and that&#x2019;s when I knew I had to have it, so I took it from her shelf.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t big, but it was so heavy I had to hold it in both hands. I went back home and just held it and looked at it, but I got fingerprints on it so I cleaned it off, and then wrapped it in cloth. I kept it in the cloth after that except when I wanted to look at it.<br>There was a woman named Chuvin. She was an Athyra, and she was very nice. I thought she should have the tiassa, so I left it in her house, then I went off to see a new world being made, which was very exciting.<br>When I got back, I went to look at the silver tiassa, but Chuvin didn&#x2019;t have it anymore. She had made some very pretty psiprints, though, and I got to see them. She gave me one of Yevetna Falls that&#x2019;s so good you can almost get wet looking at it. Mommy said that first, but I think it&#x2019;s funny and true, so I&#x2019;m saying it now. I asked Chuvin what she did with the tiassa, but she said she didn&#x2019;t know, it just got lost somehow.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t hard to find it, though. When you looked in what the Necromancer calls the other place, it was like a big white light, with two blinking blue thingies. I saw it right away, and followed it because I wanted to know where it was, and really I just wanted to see it again. It isn&#x2019;t hard to follow something in the other place, but it&#x2019;s hard to talk about. It&#x2019;s like painting when you don&#x2019;t have paint, or singing when there&#x2019;s no song, or talking when there are no words. I can&#x2019;t explain. Anyway, I followed it.<br>It was an old man who had it. He was a Lyorn and his name was Pindua. He made statues from big pieces of marble. I got to hold the tiassa for a little while, but then I left it with him. He made one called &#x201c;Worill Reclining on Stairway&#x201d; that they put in the Hall of Monuments in the Imperial Palace.<br>A little while after he made it he died and they brought him to the Paths of the Dead. He owed a lot of money when he died, and when that happens they sell all your things to try to pay the people you owe money to, so the tiassa was sold to a man named Paarfi who was a Hawk and who wrote books.<br>I didn&#x2019;t think about it for a long time, but then I remembered it one day a year later, which was almost three hundred Real Years later. I looked for it, and Paarfi still had it. I went to talk to him about it. He talked about what he was writing. He was a nice man.<br>I told him he should give the tiassa away, and he agreed, but said he wanted to keep it a little longer, until he finished his new book. I said that was okay, and he gave me one of his books and signed it for me. He wrote, &#x201c;To Devera, a very special little girl.&#x201d; I took it to Grandma&#x2019;s and put it in the chest with my things, next to the seashell that whistles &#x201c;March to the Kaanas&#x201d; and the psiprint of Yevetna Falls and the tick-ticker and some other stuff I want to keep.<br>While I was there, Grandma asked me what I was doing, and I said I was looking for the silver tiassa and she asked what that was so I explained where it came from. She asked some questions about it, but she had the look she gets when she&#x2019;s being nice and doesn&#x2019;t really care about what you&#x2019;re telling her, so pretty soon I said good-bye and ran off.<br>I went to a place called Tanvir where it was just spring and there were flowers in all the colors there are. After that, I went to an empty tower in a dead city and a man made of metal played music for me. After a while, I started wanting to see the tiassa again, so I went back to fifty Real Years later, and Paarfi still had it. I thought it was long enough, so I took it but left him a note, then I went to Adrilankha ten Real Years ahead and played with Vlad Norathar. I showed him how to look in the other place, and he showed me how to make a spinnystick with glitters.<br>Then I was tired from all the jumping around so I put my spinnystick in the chest and took a nap. Mommy says naps are good for you, but I only take them when I&#x2019;m sleepy. When I woke up again I found Daddy and showed him the tiassa and he said it was very pretty. I asked if he was ever going to come visit me and Mommy and he said he would soon because he wanted his sword back. He looked angry when he said it so I didn&#x2019;t ask about it any more. While I was there Mafenyi came up and said I shouldn&#x2019;t have stolen the tiassa and had to give it back and Daddy told her not to accuse me of stealing but I said I had just borrowed it to give to some people who needed it. They started arguing with each other so I left and took the tiassa with me.<br>I started to Mommy&#x2019;s but then a while later I looked in the other place, and saw Mafenyi was coming after me. I hadn&#x2019;t thought she wanted the tiassa that much. I thought about jumping, but then I could never come back to now. I didn&#x2019;t want to go to Grandma&#x2019;s, because then she would fight Mafenyi and I&#x2019;d feel bad, and if I went to Mommy&#x2019;s I&#x2019;d have to explain what I did.<br>So please, Uncle Vlad.

He always kept a sleeping bag in his used Camaro's trunk anyway, and starting around mid-May, when the weather got nice everywhere but in San Francisco proper, he'd finish work and leave town in whatever direction struck his fancy. </p> <p>Even in the urbanized, over-crowded Bay Area, there were innumerable places a guy could simply pull over, park, and crash on the ground under cover of trees or bushes or in the hollow of a sand dune in one of the city or county or even national parks, at the beaches, off back roads, even in the quiet "neighborhood watch" suburbs. </p> <p>Monday the past week, while it was still light out he'd driven down to Woodside, an exclusive semi-rural enclave nestled into the foothills behind Palo Alto, and slept out under an old stone bridge over a dry creek bed. Two days later, he'd driven a couple of hundred feet down an unnamed, little-used dirt track cut into the woods behind Burlingame around Crystal Springs Reservoir. Last night, he'd gone north into Marin County, got halfway up Mount Tamalpais and pulled under an old low-hanging scrub oak in a forgotten and unpaved parking lot.</p> <p>He always woke up at first light, so this morning he was on the Golden Gate Bridge by the time the sun cleared the hills behind Oakland. He had his iPod coming through his speakers. It was mid-September and, as usual this time of year, the coastal fog was taking a break. The morning clarity under the cloudless sky was startling. Mickey could easily make out the tiny dots of the Farallons twenty some miles away over the deceptively still Pacific. </p> <p>He exited the bridge and soon found himself on Marina, cruising through the streets. The closely-set, well-maintained, beautiful low-rise homes stirred some vestigial gene he must have picked up somewhere. Just driving through a neighborhood of real honest-to-God stand-alone homes always filled him with something like contentment, although it wasn't quite that; it was more like hope that contentment and physical security was one of life's possibilities. </p> <p>This was something Mickey didn't have much personal experience with. He couldn't remember ever living in anything but an apartment house, although, his parents had apparently rented a small bungalow in the Sunset before their divorce. His sister Tamara said she vaguely remembered that house. But she was two years older than he was. Mickey had been only two when his mom had taken them from their father and moved out.</p> <p>But Mickey didn't get time to enjoy the Marina architecture this morning. A crowd was clogging the street up by the Palace of Fine Arts...; At this location, he thought somebody was probably shooting a movie&#x2014;the Palace had been a setting in both <i>Vertigo</i> and <i>The Rock</i>, among a host of other films. People loved the old domed structure that had been constructed for the Panama-Pacific Exhibition back in 1915. With its classical columns and its reflecting lagoon, the spot conjured both urban elegance and a hint of mystery. So he pulled into the Yacht Club parking lot, where he knew you could always get a spot at this time of the morning.</p> <p>When Mickey got out of his car, he was surprised that the noises carrying from down by the Palace seemed distinctly ominous and angry. Someone was giving harsh orders on a bullhorn. He heard a full-throated chorus of discontent&#x2014;maybe actors and extras emoting, but he didn't think so. </p> <p>Mostly, it sounded like a fight.</p> <p>*</p> <p>From the outskirts of the crowd, Mickey could make out at least three distinct groups, not including the vans from two of the local television stations. </p> <p>The police, at least twenty of them, six of them mounted on horseback, held a line near the shoreline of the lagoon. The non-equestrian cops were turned out in "hats and bats" -- full assault gear, helmets with tinted facemasks, batons out. A larger homogeneous and clearly hostile group of maybe fifty citizens milled around on the sloping banks of the lagoon as if waiting for instructions to charge the police line. In front of them, a tall bearded guy in camo gear was right up in the face of the lead cop with the bullhorn. Finally, down by the water's edge, a smaller group of perhaps twenty people in the uniforms of the city's Parks and Recreation department huddled fearfully by a small fleet of rowboats laden with what looked like netting of some kind.</p> <p>The camo guy started a chant, "Hell, no, don't let them go!" and in seconds the crowd was in full throat behind him, pressing forward toward the police line. The cops brought up their batons as the bullhorn exhorted the crowd to "Back away! Back away!"</p> <p>"Hell, no, don't let them go!"</p> <p>A white-haired man in a bathrobe and tennis shoes with his arms crossed and wearing a bemused expression stood on a lawn across the street. Mickey sidled up next to him. "What's going on?" he asked.</p> <p>The man shook his head. "Idiots."</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>"All of &#x2018;em."</p> <p>"But what's it about?"</p> <p>The man looked over, askance. "You don't know about the ducks? Where you been?"</p> <p>"What about the ducks?"</p> <p>"They're moving 'em, or trying to." He shook his head again. "Lunatics. Stupid idea, bad planning, insane timing. But what else do you expect nowadays, huh? You really don't know about this? Moving the ducks down to Foster City?"</p> <p>"Ahh." So that's what this was. Mickey had read all about it over the past few months, but hadn't realized that it was coming to a head so soon. Now the whole story came back to him. </p> <p>The city had approved a $22 million restoration for the Palace and its grounds, and part of that project included buttressing the remainder of the shoreline of the lagoon, most of which was already bounded by a low rock-and-concrete wall. But the rest of the shoreline, closest in toward the Palace itself, had become degraded over time&#x2014;in the past year alone, a couple of kids had fallen in when the banks had collapsed under them. It wasn't so much dangerous as it opened the city to possible litigation issues, and so the supervisors had given the plan the green light, and put up $7.5 million to get the project started. The rest would, somehow, be funded by private benefactors. And lo, it had come to pass. </p> <p>But to do any of this work, first the lagoon had to be drained.</p> <p>Enter the ducks. And the San Francisco Palace Duck Coalition. And a former Berkeley tree sitter who, for the present campaign, had adopted the <i>nom de guerre </i> of Eric Canard. Mickey only now came to recognize the man in his camo gear. Usually he did photo ops in a full duck suit.</p> <p>The Palace ducks, of course, along with its swans, herons, seagulls and other birds, called the lagoon home. And if the lagoon were drained, Canard had argued to the Board of Supervisors, they would become homeless. Temporarily, but truly. And in a city that prided itself on being a haven to the homeless, this was simply unacceptable. </p> <p>So the supervisors, caving in -- to widespread derision in the media and on the street -- had set about finding a solution to the problem. In spite of the fact that San Francisco had several nice and completely serviceable ponds, those ponds had their own populations of ducks whose environments, Canard argued, would be compromised by the wholesale relocation of the Palace ducks to their own home waters. So, eventually, the decision was made to relocate the ducks to Foster City, a residential community with Venice-like canals, and few permanent resident ducks, twenty miles south down the Peninsula. </p> <p>This would have been a workable though of course still wildly foolish idea except for one thing: six months before, Foster City had encountered its own problem with its indigenous ground squirrel population. These animals were burrowing in the city's levees and destroying them, threatening homes with the very real possibility of imminent flooding. In response to this crisis, Foster City had decided to poison the levee-dwelling critters en masse. This slaughter passed largely unnoticed in Foster City itself, but did not escape the keen eye of Eric Canard. And when San Francisco announced its intention to remove its Palace ducks to Foster City, Canard had gone ballistic. </p> <p>Surely, if the ducks were sent to Foster City, the heartless bureaucrats there would not treasure and protect them. These people had shown their true colors around the plight of defenseless animals and would obviously treat the ducks as they had treated their own squirrels if given half a chance. And Canard was not going to let that happen.</p> <p>So he'd sued. And lost.</p> <p>And had threatened to sue again. Which gave the city a window in which to make its move.</p> <p> Across the street, the chant was wearing down, but Mickey could still hear a strong voice&#x2014;undoubtedly Canard&#x2014;yelling now at the lead cop.</p> <p>"So how'd this start today?" he asked. "I thought it was still in the courts." </p> <p>"No. The brains down at City Hall decided they'd just go ahead and round up the birds. The whole thing is nuts. And it's all moot anyway. They started draining the lake a couple of days ago before they were ready for the ducks&#x2014;in secret, I might add, and that's never a good idea&#x2014;so word got out to Canard and his people that something was happening down here, and the whack jobs started gathering before sunrise this morning.

From the crisp quiet of a solitary week spent in the snowbound Maine woods to the expectant chaos of Hong Kong on the eve of the Hand-over, Theroux demonstrates how the traveling life and the writing life are intimately connected. His journeys in remote hinterlands and crowded foreign capitals provide the necessary perspective to &#34;become a stranger&#34; in order to discover the self. A companion volume to SUNRISE WITH SEAMONSTERS, FRESH AIR FIEND is the ultimate good read for anyone fascinated by travel in the wider world or curious about the life of one of our most passionate travelers.</p><p>Paul Theroux may be pompous, self-important, cynical, and grumpy. He may even be, as accused by a heckler in Australia, "a wanker." So what? The man is prolific--having penned 36 books--and when he's inspired, his insights and sparkling writing are so startling that it's easy to forgive him for his occasional crankiness. Besides, as he reminds readers frequently, he is a man who takes pen to paper for a living; as the title essay points out: "Normal, happy, well-balanced individuals seldom become imaginative writers...."<p> In <i>Fresh Air Fiend</i>, Theroux's pen serves him well with astute, lively pieces that stray far beyond simple "travel essays" and reveal his self-inflicted lifestyle of compulsive travel, writing, and alienation. In this collection--containing mostly previously published magazine pieces written over the past 15 years--there's a strong autobiographical streak, as well as historical perspectives and a sardonic view on aging. "One of the more bewildering aspects of growing older," he writes in "'Memory and Creation,'" "is that people constantly remind you of things that never happened." </p><p> Now nearly 60, Theroux has lived a rich, varied life: the book jumps from post-Mao China and years spent as an Africa-based Peace Corps volunteer in the '60s to turtle watching in Hawaii and kayaking on Cape Cod; the jumbled collection even includes pieces on other travel writers (Bruce Chatwin, Graham Greene, and William Least Heat-Moon) and the film adaptation of his novel <i>The Mosquito Coast</i>. A chronic sense of aloneness permeates all these pieces--be it the lost traveler paddling through fog, the lone writer living without a phone, or the hermetic trekker who can't speak the native language. Most touching: a short sketch of a road trip when he's lost, his wife is anxious, and the children are fighting; Theroux doesn't want the moment to end and soon enough he returns to his self-imposed alienation. It's that perpetual sense of loneliness and not fitting in that seems to motivate Theroux in many of these essays. Theroux may be getting older, even nostalgic, but as these vibrant essays show, he sure isn't getting stale. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>Paul Theroux has been hailed as the best travel writer of his generation. <i>Fresh-Air Fiend</i> is an essential collection, which includes 52 remarkable pieces written over the last 15 years. Wonderfully broad in scope, thought, and feeling, the book touches down on five continents and floats through most of the seas in between. From the snowbound Maine woods, to the expectant chaos of Hong Kong on the eve of the Hand-over, to a remote island in the Pacific where the first atomic bombs were detonated, Theroux is the perfect guide &#x2013; casually informative, keenly observant, wry, and entertaining. As <i>Time</i> has written, Theroux "serves as both the camera and the eye, and both the details and the illusions are developed with brilliance."</p><h2>Midnight Crystal (Dreamlight Trilogy Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)</h2><p>The new head of the local Ghost Hunter Guild, Adam Winters finds an unexpected ally in Marlowe Jones, a psychic private investigator and dreamlight reader who is the only one who can help him break a legendary curse and save the underworld.</p><p>Jayne Castle, the author of After Glow, After Dark, Ghost Hunter, Silver Master, and Dark Light, is a pseudonym for Jayne Ann Krentz, the New York Times bestselling author of All Night Long, Falling Awake, Truth or Dare, Light in Shadow, Smoke in Mirrors, Lost and Found, Summer in Eclipse Bay, Dawn in Eclipse Bay, Eclipse Bay, and other novels.

While exploring the rain forest and catacombs under Frequency, Adam discovers a mirrored maze that could be the power force that has kept Harmony running for centuries, but something about the maze&#x2019;s energy patterns is dangerously out of sync.

In Cooked, Michael Pollan discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements-- fire, water, air, and earth-- to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer-- and finds that reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self- reliance opens the door to a more nourishing life.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, April 2013</strong>: Who has untangled the nature of modern America&#x2019;s relationship with food more effectively than Michael Pollan? After sharing the experience of growing his own food in <i>Second Nature</i>, he illuminated how our appetites drive the evolution of edible plants with <i>The Botany of Desire</i>. Then he pondered <i>The Omnivore&#x2019;s Dilemma</i>, weighing our precarious food chain and popularizing the pleasures of eating local; <i>In Defense of Food</i> and <i>Food Rules</i> distilled his conclusions into a manifesto and a manual. With <i>Cooked</i>, he closes the seed-to-table loop with a passionate exploration of the satisfying transformation of grilling, braising, baking, and fermenting--and their primal roots. Learning to cook elevated humans from lone animals into increasingly intelligent, civilized groups, and though we spend scant time doing real cooking, we&#x2019;ve become obsessed with watching people cook--a paradox that points to longing for a lost experience. Through his own experiences making and enjoying food with pit masters, chefs, bakers, and &#x201c;fermentos,&#x201d; he retraces our path to connection with real ingredients and health for people and planet. Whether you&#x2019;re sympathetic or skeptical, you can&#x2019;t help but appreciate Pollan&#x2019;s genius for conveying the elemental appeal of making a meal. <i>--Mari Malcolm</i>MICHAEL POLLAN is the author of six previous books, including <i>Food Rules, In Defense of Food, The Omnivore s Dilemma</i>, and <i>The Botany of Desire</i>, all <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

The story sat undisclosed for nearly 70 years and is now brought to life in The Lost Airman.<p><b>Prologue</b></p><br><p><b>A Needle in A Haystack</b></p><p>On June 18, 1944, a young man lurched across the searing sand of Rockaway Beach, New York. As he picked his way through a maze of blankets, beach chairs, and umbrellas, throngs of beachgoers stared at him. He looked out of place in long pants hiked up to his ankles and a sweat-dampened, white button-down shirt embroidered with his name. Among the crowd in bathing suits and trunks, it was not his attire that caught people&#x2019;s attention. It was the cardboard sign he held aloft. He was looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.</p><p>The young man had received a frantic telephone call an hour ear- lier at the beachfront candy store where he worked. An urgent voice had launched him out into the sweltering heat with a message he had hastily scrawled on the cardboard. He was hoping to find someone, a husband and wife whom he had never met, had never even seen.</p><p>Scores of men and women were watching the candy clerk as they enjoyed the hot summer day, some casting brief glances, others staring intently. They instinctively understood the sign&#x2019;s message. America&nbsp;had now been at war with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan for some two and a half years, and most people on the beach knew someone in uniform. Many had lost a loved one in action. As more and more beachgoers realized what the young man was doing, they stepped aside to let him pass. A handful of the more curious ones trailed him down the shoreline.</p><p>Frequently wiping his brow, squinting from the sunlight, he wan- dered up and down the beach for more than an hour, his face flushed from the heat and visibly sunburned. As the minutes dragged on, he could not help but think that he had been dispatched on a well- intentioned but futile errand. He wondered what the chances were that his message would find the two total strangers in the dense crowds. Still, he kept walking, with the sign over his head, through the forest of umbrellas.</p><p>He stopped to take a few long breaths, his arms aching from hold- ing up the sign. Several yards behind him, a middle-aged couple and a pretty, black-haired young woman stumbled through the thick white sand toward him. Tears streamed down their sun-darkened faces. They had spotted the words hastily scrawled on the cardboard sign.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>&#x201c;Just A Milk RuN&#x201d;</p><p><i>December 31, Early Morning of New Year&#x2019;s Eve, 1943</i><br><i>Seething Airfield, Norfolk, England<br>&nbsp;</i></p><p>An icy gust slapped against Staff Sergeant Arthur Meyerowitz as he stepped outside from the 448th Bomb Group&#x2019;s aluminum-walled mess hall just after 5 a.m. Wincing, he turned up the fleece collar of his leather bomber jacket and tugged his cap and earmuffs tightly. He peered for a few moments at the neat rows of cylindrical barracks arrayed on frost-cloaked farmland along the southern flank of Seeth- ing Airfield, home to his unit, the 715th Squadron, in Norfolk, England. He lingered on the mess hall&#x2019;s stoop as other airmen and pilots brushed past him.</p><p>A hell of a way to spend the last day of the year, he thought, but he had to do the premission checks for <i>Harmful Lil Armful</i>, a B-24&nbsp;Liberator in the 448th Bomb Group. He had been up since 2:30 a.m., when he had been rousted from sleep by an officer&#x2019;s flashlight and ordered to go out with <i>Harmful Lil Armful</i>, whose flight engineer and top-turret gunner, Sergeant George Glevanick, had just been&nbsp;rushed to the base hospital. Now, after the premission briefing and breakfast, Arthur steeled himself for his second mission.</p><p>His maiden mission had come on December 24 aboard a B-24 named <i>Consolidated Mess</i>. The target was a Nazi V-1 missile site at Labroye, a relatively short hop across the English Channel in the Pas-de-Calais, in northern France. With luck, Arthur might be back at Seething in time for the New Year&#x2019;s Eve parties that he had planned to attend on base and in Norwich, some ten miles away on the east coast.</p><p>Lucky bastard, he mused about Glevanick, shivering. At least Glevanick was guaranteed to make it into 1944. Then Arthur lowered his shoulder against the raw wind and stepped off the stoop onto a muddy path that wound toward three concrete airstrips.</p><p>A few yards from the mess hall, Arthur spotted a group of young Englishwomen, slowed down, and removed his cap and earmuffs as he passed them. Despite the early hour, they were waiting to pick up their 8th Air Force boyfriends who had two-day passes for New Year&#x2019;s Eve and Day. Usually, the girlfriends had to stand outside the main gate, but they had been allowed on the base for the holidays after a security check.</p><p>As they waited for their airmen to emerge from the building, the women were chatting amid a swirl of cigarette smoke. Running his hand through his dense, dark hair, Arthur shot them a grin. Several smiled back at the handsome twenty-five-year-old airman.</p><p>A pretty blonde spotted Arthur&#x2019;s shoulder patch, which was embla- zoned with the image of a grinning, muscular rabbit clad in a super- hero&#x2019;s costume and cape who was perched atop a light blue bomb.</p><p>&#x201c;The 715th, is it? Where are the Rabbits off to, then, in such a rush so close to New Year&#x2019;s?&#x201d; she called out.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a date with some Germans,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Good luck&#x2014;and give the bastards our regards,&#x201d; another woman chimed in as Arthur picked up his pace and waved.1</p><p>Attention from women was something Arthur was used to. The five-foot ten-inch, 160-pound staff sergeant possessed the street smarts and swagger of his Bronx neighborhood, and he exuded a con- fidence to which women were drawn. Before enlisting in the Army, Arthur had loved dressing stylishly, heading to the Garment District and stretching part of his paychecks into good deals on fashionable clothes. His family was accustomed to seeing beautiful young women on his well-tailored sleeves.</p><p>At Norfolk, Arthur enjoyed chatting with attractive Englishwomen, but it never went beyond a few pints and dances in town or on base. Tucked in the breast pocket of his flight suit, his wallet held a snapshot of Esther Loew, his dark-haired, dark-eyed girlfriend back in the Bronx. An aunt had introduced him to the pretty twenty-one-year-old Esther before he had shipped out to England, and he was quickly smitten, so much so that he had considered marriage. He had decided, however, that with the casualty rate of bomber crews in the European and Pacific theaters of operation reaching the highest of any service branch&#x2014;even more than the submarine fleet&#x2014;he could not justify making her another in the sadly burgeoning ranks of young war widows. Still, she intended to wait for him, and he could not talk her out of it.</p><p>Arthur carried another memento of home besides Esther&#x2019;s photo. Around his neck was a thin gold chain with a <i>chai</i>, the Hebrew sym- bol for &#x201c;life.&#x201d; His mother had given it to him before he had left for England.</p><p>As the rows of B-24s lining the airstrip materialized through the mist and freezing rain, Arthur had no time to think of Esther and of his parents and brother back in New York. <i>Harmful Lil Armful </i>had to be inspected, and his crewmates depended on Arthur, the flight engineer, to make sure that the plane was fit to fly. Everyone knew that the Allied invasion of Fortress Europe loomed. The waves of American and British bombers pounding German targets in France around the clock were &#x201c;preparing the ground&#x201d; for Operation Overlord,&nbsp;the largest amphibious assault in history. What no one except the top brass knew yet was where and when the Allies would strike across the British Channel.</p><p>A few hours earlier at the mission briefing, the 448th&#x2019;s charismatic commander, thirty-seven-year-old Colonel James M. Thompson, had unveiled a huge map of Europe and thrust a pointer at three red- circled spots. Silence enveloped the crowded room as the pilots and crews waited to hear Thompson, whose neatly parted salt-and-pepper hair and trim Clark Gable mustache made him the very picture of a tough pilot and leader, speak in his no-nonsense Texan drawl. From airfields across eastern and central England, 250 B-17s and B-24s, including <i>Harmful Lil Armful</i>, would be escorted by hundreds of P-47</p><p>Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang fighter planes as they unleashed a daylight strike against the Nazi airfield at La Rochelle/Laleu, south- west of the Brest Peninsula. If the clouds over the site proved too dense, the secondary target was another Nazi airstrip, at Ch�teau- bernard.</p><p>Thompson, a nerveless pilot who had racked up fifty-five missions over Europe and had earned a reputation for never sugarcoating danger for his men, told the assembled airmen that German flak and fighter attacks all the way into and out of the target run would be intense.</p><p>Arthur knew they would soon be &#x201c;in the soup&#x201d; over France. Arthur could never have envisioned that he would see France or&nbsp;England, let alone go to war. Still, the eldest son of David and Rose&nbsp;Meyerowitz had always thirsted for adventure.</p><p>Arthur was born on August 15, 1918, in the Bronx, in a tough neighborhood largely composed of Jewish, Irish, and Italian families crowded into old, yellow-brick, flat-roofed apartment buildings that clotted Findlay Avenue. At 1205 Findlay Avenue, built in 1915, the Meyerowitz family lived in a third-floor, one-bedroom apartment.&nbsp;David and Rose had a second child, Seymour, on August 11, 1927. When Seymour was old enough, he and Arthur shared a Murphy bed in the living room.</p><p>Forty-three-year-old David Meyerowitz had emigrated from Roma- nia to New York as a boy and had been compelled to leave school at eighth grade to help the family survive. He went on to work as a driver and salesman in the wholesale bakery business and to marry Rose Blumen- thal, a vivacious, dark-haired woman born and raised in the Bronx. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, times turned increasingly tight for the Meyerowitz family and their Findlay Avenue neighbors. David always managed to keep his family fed, housed, and clothed, but money was always short. He and Rose were constantly juggling the bills, unable to think about moving out of their apartment.</p><p>To survive on Findlay Avenue, Arthur learned how to use both his instincts and his fists. He had to because on the corners of Find- lay and adjoining streets, Russian and Eastern European Jews, Irish, and Italian kids claimed patches of local asphalt as their personal turf. In Arthur&#x2019;s building people watched out for each other, and when a job was lost or an illness struck families, neighbors helped out as best they could.</p><p>Raised to respect women and imbued with a strong sense of right and wrong, Arthur was never afraid to stand up to bullies. Once, when the din of a man beating his wife echoed down the third-floor hallway of the apartment complex, Arthur rushed toward the noise and started banging on the neighbors&#x2019; apartment door. The husband opened it, red-faced and sweating. In the small living room, his wife was sobbing, her clothes disheveled, bruises rising on her face.</p><p>Arthur, clenching his fists at his side, glared at the older man, who backed away a step as Arthur stood in the doorway, saying nothing, his eyes still fixed on the neighbor. Then Arthur leaned forward, jabbed a finger just under the man&#x2019;s chin, and nodded in the direction of the cringing woman. Arthur turned around and waited for the door to&nbsp;close. He lingered in the hall, listening as the man and the woman talked in low, almost hushed tones. There were no more slaps or shouts.</p><p>Over the following days and weeks, it became apparent that the husband had gotten the message: if he threatened his wife again, his tough young neighbor would give him a dose of the same. The beat- ings stopped.</p><p>Arthur graduated from Robert Morris High School, built in 1897 as the first public high school in the Bronx, and the education he received in the soaring Gothic brick structure complete with turrets and spires was rated as one of the finest offered by any of the city&#x2019;s public high schools. In the school&#x2019;s sprawling auditorium, Arthur and the rest of the student body gathered for daily assemblies amid the hall&#x2019;s ornate columns and a commemorative World War I mural that would earn the school a place on the National Historic Register. Arthur saw that masterpiece daily for four school years. The mural had been rendered by renowned French artist August Gorguet and entitled <i>After Conflict Comes Peace</i>. At the time, the vivid images of war-scarred France did not matter much to the teenager.</p><p>After his 1936 graduation from Morris, Arthur immediately began working; any thought of college was out of the question with the Depression still battering the nation and the family needing every dol- lar. He sold electrical fixtures for Jack Meyerowitz, his uncle, and dou- bled as a receiving and shipping clerk and supervisor of ten men for a wholesale lampshade company in Brooklyn for three and a half years. Although fortunate to have any work in the midst of the Depression, in 1939 Arthur was employed only for twenty-eight weeks, earning $400. Fortunately for the family, his father worked all fifty-two weeks and brought home $1,560, but there was never much left over after the bills were paid.</p><p>Wanting to contribute more and finding his life too sedate despite his busy social calendar, Arthur began to think about other avenues for a steadier and more exciting financial future. He had always been&nbsp;interested in airplanes and yearned for the chance to fly, and in late&nbsp;1940, he spoke to an Army recruiter in Manhattan about the Army Air Corps. The sergeant told Arthur that a college education was not mandatory for aviation cadets so long as they had graduated from a good high school. The recruiter added that once Arthur completed basic training, he &#x201c;could transfer to the Air Corps if he passed the physical and mental examinations.&#x201d;</p><p>Filled with excitement, Arthur, who had never traveled beyond New York and New Jersey, signed a one-year enlistment paper on January 8, 1941. He was formally inducted at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and was soon on his way to basic infantry training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.<br><br>Once he completed basic, Arthur made two requests to his com- manding officer: a pass to attend Seymour&#x2019;s Bar Mitzvah in New York and the application to transfer to the Army Air Corps. The officer turned down the Bar Mitzvah pass brusquely and then set Private Meyerowitz straight regarding aviation training&#x2014;Arthur had signed up for one year, and the Army did not allow such enlistees to waste its time and money in flight school. The recruiting sergeant had lied to him, and Arthur, furious but trapped, started counting the days until January 8, 1942, when his assignment would be complete. Meanwhile, he sent Seymour one month&#x2019;s Army wages as a Bar Mitzvah present. He earned stellar reviews from his superiors first as a rifleman and then as a .50-caliber machine gunner.</p><p>On December 7, 1941, about a month before his enlistment was up, Arthur was stunned by the news of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x2019;s strike against Pearl Harbor. He immediately signed up for three more years, out of patriotism, out of the certainty that he would be drafted anyway, and out of hope that he could now transfer to the Air Cor...</p></p><h2>Second Act Trouble: Behind the Scenes at Broadway&#39;s Big Musical Bombs (Applause Books)</h2><p>If Broadway's triumphant musical hits are exhilarating, the backstage tales of Broadway failures are tantalizing soap operas in miniature. <i>Second Act Trouble</i> puts you with the creators in the rehearsal halls, at out-of-town tryouts, in late-night, hotel-room production meetings, and at after-the-fact recriminatory gripe fests. Suskin has compiled and annotated long-forgotten, first-person accounts of 25 Broadway musicals that stubbornly went awry. Contributions come from such respected writers as Patricia Bosworth, Mel Gussow, Lehman Engel, William Gibson, Lewis H. Lapham, and John Gruen. No mere vanity productions, these; you can't have a big blockbuster of failure, it seems, without the participation of Broadway's biggest talents. Caught in the stranglehold of tryout turmoil are Richard Rodgers, Jule Styne, Jerry Herman, Cy Coleman, Charles Strouse, John Kander, Mel Brooks, and even Edward Albee., The infamous shows featured include <i>Mack &amp; Mabel; Breakfast at Tiffany's; The Act; Dude; Golden Boy; Hellzapoppin'; Nick and Nora; Seesaw; Kelly; and How Now, Dow Jones</i>.</p><p>Steven Suskin has written a dozen books on theatre and music, including <i>A Must See! Brilliant Broadway Artwork</i>(0811842177'), '<i>Show Tunes: The Songs, Shows, and Careers of Broadway's Major Composers</i>(019125991'), 'and the <i>Broadway Yearbook</i> series. A long-time theatrical manager and producer, he lives in New York with his wife and two children.What makes a musical go wrong? Theatrical manager and producer Suskin (<i>Show Tunes</i>; Broadway Yearbook series) attempts an answer in this lightly entertaining, obsessively edited compilation of newspaper and magazine articles and memoir excerpts, enlightened and corrected by Suskin's own commentary. A flop usually boils down to a few variables: conflicting artistic visions and/or personality conflicts, "star vehicles that failed," a nonexistent second act or costly rewrites and recastings. The earliest musical documented is <i>Flying Colors</i> (1932), the latest <i>The Red Shoes</i> (1993), with the majority from the '60s and '70s and no examples from the AIDS-torn '80s. Most of these gossip-laden, name-dropping, cattily amusing essays are too short to give more than the sketchiest outline of a show's trials and tribulations. Aspiring Broadway writers and producers looking for edification may be frustrated. The two exceptions are William Gibson's deeply felt excerpt about the posthumous musicalization of his close friend Clifford Odets's <i>Golden Boy</i>, an essay so literarily superior that Suskin refrains from his standard in-essay editorializing, and the book's grand finale, Lewis H. Lapham's long, funny, in-depth <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> article about the 1965 disaster <i>Kelly</i>. 100 color and b&amp;w illus. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We hear from the persecutors themselves: the leaders of the Nazi party, the members of the Protestant and Catholic hierarchies, the university elites, and the heads of the business community. Most telling of all, perhaps, are the testimonies of ordinary German citizens, who in the main acquiesced to increasing waves of dismissals, segregation, humiliation, impoverishment, expulsion, and violence.</p></p><p><p>Born in Prague, Saul Friedl�nder spent his boyhood in Nazi-occupied France. He is a professor of history at UCLA, and has written numerous books on Nazi Germany and World War II.</p>At first glance, the volume before us is a conventional enough historical narrative. Divided into two roughly equal parts, it recounts the step-by-step process by which the Nazi regime tightened its menacing grip over the Jews of Germany in the years between 1933 and 1939. In a welcome departure from much current Holocaust historiography, Friedlander weaves the victims' story into his general narrative, showing the often tardy and confused responses of Jews at all levels of society as they became tangled in the ever-growing web of administrative measures aimed against them. <p>The great virtue of Friedlander's presentation lies in his ability to juxtapose different themes and facets while preserving an orderly chronological narrative. We are shown the international as well as the domestic context of Hitler's speeches relating to Jews; the callous and cynical deliberations of Nazi leaders, as well as the decisions of lower-level functionaries; the passivity of ordinary Germans, as well as the despair of the trapped Jewish victims. Moreover, by skillfully introducing some of the methods of contemporary social history (which in the past he has criticized), Friedlander persuasively demonstrates the great variety of individual situations in Nazi Germany, especially during the early years. </p><p>Despite its carefully differentiated analysis, Freidlander's book nonetheless has its weaknesses. Considerably more attention might have been paid to the response of German Jewry to its impoverishment, isolation, and persecution. There is virtually no mention of Jewish religious leaders and their reactions, no discussion of the German Jewish intellectuals and the way they confronted Nazi policy. Nor is there much information about internal deliberations within communal bodies. Similarly unexplored are the dilemmas posed by emigration from the Third Reich, as well as the effects of positions adopted by German Zionists. </p><p>Friedlander remains cautious to a fault about shaping his material into a cohesive whole or offering anything like an overall interpretation of the events he describes. Notwithstanding its wealth of insight and detail, reading this book is thus, at times, an oddly frustrating experience. Still, it remains a considerable achievement, an important landmark in the as yet unfinished project of grasping the nature and the meaning of the Holocaust. -- <i>Commentary, Robert S. Wistrich</i><br><br>Mr. Friedl�nder draws strength from memory, yet adheres scrupulously to the discipline of a historian's detachment. He writes history with a novelist's sense of the telling detail; he is both analytic and evocative. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, Fritz Stern</i></p></p><h2>The Napoleon of Crime: The Life and Times of Adam Worth, Master Thief</h2><p><i>He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson.<br>He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city.<br>He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. . . . </i><br>--Sherlock Holmes on Professor Moriarty in "The Final Problem"<br><br>The Victorian era's most infamous thief, Adam Worth was the original Napoleon of crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suave, cunning Worth learned early that the best way to succeed was to steal.&nbsp;&nbsp;And steal he did.<br><br>Following a strict code of honor, Worth won the respect of Victorian society.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also aroused its fear by becoming a chilling phantom, mingling undetected with the upper classes, whose valuables he brazenly stole.&nbsp;&nbsp;His most celebrated heist: Gainsborough's grand portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire--ancestor of Diana, Princess of Wales--a painting Worth adored and often slept with for twenty years.<br><br>With a brilliant gang that included "Piano" Charley, a jewel thief, train robber, and playboy, and "the Scratch" Becker, master forger, Worth secretly ran operations from New York to London, Paris, and South Africa--until betrayal and a Pinkerton man finally brought him down.<br><br>In a decadent age, Worth was an icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;His biography is a grand, dazzling tour into the gaslit underworld of the last century.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;and into the doomed genius of a criminal mastermind.</p><p>Arthur Conan Doyle fictionalized him as the superhuman Professor Moriarty, and the popular press luridly chronicled his daring heists, though the police never managed to convict him of anything major until he was nearly 50. Forgotten since his 19th-century heyday, master thief Adam Worth (1844-1902) gets a contemporary dusting-off in this cheerfully cynical biography by a British journalist, who sees Worth&#39;s story as a case study in Victorian hypocrisy.

She also had a brief career as a fashion model in New York City. Her novels featuring Superintendent Anders Knutas and the journalist Johan Berg are set on the island of Gotland, where Jungstedt resides during the summer months. Six titles have been the basis for Swedish movies. Mari Jungstedt lives in Stockholm, Sweden, and has two children.The fourth book in the Anders Knutas series, this brooding thriller is set on Sweden&#x2019;s largest island, Gotland, a place that has such a palpable creepiness about it that it almost becomes another character in the story. Egon Wallin is a successful art dealer about to embark on some serious lifestyle changes. But those plans are thwarted when he is murdered and left to hang on Dalman Gate in downtown Visby, a historic town in Gotland. A woman out for an early-morning stroll finds the body, and the press are there almost as quickly as the police, somewhat hampering the investigation. A famous Swedish painting called The Dying Dandy has been stolen, and there seems to be a link between the theft and the murder. There is an underlying theme about the media and corruption that pervades the story, adding additional depth, but the virtuous journalist Johan Berg helps balance things a bit. This is excellent Scandinavian noir, as first popularized by Steig Larsson, and a beautifully written addition to the genre. --Stacy Alesi</p><h2>The New Harvard Guide to Women&#39;s Health (Harvard University Press Reference Library)</h2><p><p> With the publication in 1996 of <i>The Harvard Guide to Women's Health</i>, women seeking answers to questions about their health had access to the combined expertise of physicians from three of the world's most prestigious medical institutions: Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham and Women's Hospital. With complete information on women's health concerns, physical and behavioral, this A to Z reference quickly became a definitive resource, praised especially for its coverage of topics not previously considered under the umbrella of women's health. <i>The New Harvard Guide to Women's Health</i> reunites the authors to bring a valued health reference up to date for a new generation--and for those women who have come to rely on the <i>Harvard Guide</i> and are now wondering what to do about their health as they enter a new stage of life, asking questions like the following: I've been on hormone replacement therapy. Should I stop? How?</p><p> Could this rash be lupus?</p><p> I've been on the Pill. What is my risk for stroke?</p><p> Fat is bad, fat is good: What should I believe? And what's left to eat?</p><p> When does ordinary worry become chronic anxiety?</p><p> What screening tests do I need now?</p><p> In addition to revised recommendations reflecting the current medical thinking on menopause and hormone replacement therapy, the <i>New Harvard Guide</i> includes updated recommendations about cardiac health and heart disease--the #1 killer of women in the United States</p><p> entries reflecting recent advances in the understanding and treatment of autoimmune diseases</p><p> better coverage of health concerns throughout a woman's life span, from her first period to menopause and beyond, with a new entry on perimenopause</p><p> expanded nutritional recommendations, including a unique chart of the U.S. government's Daily Reference Intakes for micronutrients, broken down for teens and women whose needs may differ because they are pregnant, breastfeeding, or postmenopausal</p><p> updated information on over-the-counter medications, prescription drugs, procedures, screenings, and diagnostic tests</p><p> </p></p><p>A well-researched update to the 1996 edition, <i>The New Harvard Guide to Women's Health</i> is an essential reference guide for women of every age. Combining simple alphabetical listings with complete cross-referencing throughout the 300 topics, it's easy to find what you're looking for--anything from airbags to wrinkles, asthma or vulvar cancer. Many of the entries include illustrations, and a number of anatomical charts give welcome assistance if you can't quite remember where your inguinal nodes or tibial nerves are hiding. Making use of the most current research, much of it from the Women's Health Initiative, the advice combines alternative therapies with advanced diagnostic suggestions and the latest recommendations for physical exams. Unlike some medical reference books, the tone here is reassuring--not scary. The authors (also responsible for the first edition) do a fine job of balancing potential serious diseases with the general likelihood that the majority of us are fairly healthy--and just as concerned about hair dye as we are our blood pressure. Best of all, the wide range of topics covered make it equally appropriate as a gift for a girl going off to college (or even just entering puberty), and for a mother concerned about dealing with menopause. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>Dr. Karen J.

He had stopped by to cadge a free meal off of us one day and found the pickings so easy he decided to stay on. He lived with us for ten years, although, as my grandmother used to say, it seemed like centuries. In all those years, he displayed not a single socially redeeming quality. If dogs were films, he'd have been X-rated.I recall one Sunday when my mother had invited the new parish priest to dinner. Our dining roomtable was situated in front of a large window overlooking the front yard. During the first course, Strange passed by the window not once but twice, walking on his front legs but dragging his rear over the grass. His mouth was split in an ear-to-ear grin of sublime relief, and possibly of pride, in his discovery of a new treatment for embarrassing itch."Well, Father," Mom said in a hasty effort at distraction, "and how do you like our little town by now?""Hunh?" the pastor said, a fork full of salad frozen in mid-stroke as he gaped out the window at the disgusting spectacle. "Pardon me, what were you saying?"During the next course, Strange appeared outside the window with the remains of some creature that had met its end sometime prior to the previous winter, no doubt something he had saved for just such a formal occasion. As he licked his chops in pretense of preparing to consume the loathsome object, Mom shot me a look that said, <i>"Kill that dog!"</i> I stepped to the door fully intending to carry out the order, but Strange ran off, snickering under his breath."More chicken, Father?" Mom asked."Thank you, I think not," the priest said, running a finger around the inside of his Roman collar, as if experiencing some welling of the throat.Fortunately, the dinner was only four courses in length, ending before Strange could stage his grand finale. A female collie, three dead rats, and the entrails of a sheep were left waiting in the wings.Mom said later she didn't know whether Strange was just being more disgusting than usual that day or had something against organized religion. In any case, it was a long while before the priest came to dinner again, our invitations invariably conflicting with funerals, baptisms, or his self-imposed days of fasting.Strange was the only dog I've ever known who could belch at will. It was his idea of high comedy. If my mother had some of her friends over for a game of pinochle, Strange would slip into the house and slouch over to the ladies. Then he would emit a loud belch. Apparently, he mistook shudders of revulsion for a form of applause, because he would sit there on his haunches, grinning modestly up at the group and preparing an encore. "Stop, stop!" he would snarl, as I dragged him back outdoors. "They love me! They'll die laughing at my other routine! It'll have them on the floor!" I will not speak here of his other routine.In general appearance, Strange could easily have been mistaken for your average brown-and-white mongrel with floppy cars and a shaggy tail, except that depravity was written all over him. He lookedas if he sold dirty postcards to support an opium habit. His eyes spoke of having known the depths of degeneracy, and approving of them.Tramps were his favorite people. If a tramp stopped by for a free meal at our picnic table and to case the place, Strange would greet him warmly, exchange bits of news about underworld connections, and leak inside information about the household: "They ain't got any decent jewelry, but the silver's not bad and there's a good radio in the living room." The tramp would reach down and scratch the dog behind the ears as a gesture of appreciation, and Strange would belch for him. Face wrinkled in disgust, the tramp would then hoist his bedroll and depart the premises, no doubt concerned about the reliability of food given him by a family that kept such a dog.My friends at school often debated the attributes of various breeds of dogs. "I tend to favor black labs," I'd say, going on to recite the various characteristics I had recently excerpted from a <i>Field &amp; Stream</i> dog column. Somehow my classmates got the impression that I actually owned a black lab and had personally observed these characteristics. While I was aware of the mistaken impression, I didn't feel it was my business to go around refuting all the rumors that happened to get started. Sooner or later, however, one of these friends would visitme at home. Strange would come out of his house and satisfy himself that the visitor wasn't a tramp in need of his counsel. That done, he would yawn, belch, gag, and return to his den of iniquity."That your uh dog?" the kid would ask."I guess so," I'd reply, embarrassed."Too bad," the kid would say. "I always thought you had a black lab.""Naw, just him. But I'm planning on buying me a black lab pup first chance I get.""I sure would," the kid would say, shaking his head.As a hunting dog, Strange was a good deal worse than no dog. Nevertheless, he clearly thought of himself as a great hunting guide. "Fresh spoor," he would say, indicating a pine cone. "We can't be far behind him. And for gosh sakes shoot straight, because I judge from the sign he'll be in a bad mood!"Chances of shooting any game at all with Strange along were nil. He had no concept of stealth. His standard hunting practice was to go through the woods shouting directions and advice to me and speculating loudly about the absence of game. I would have had more luck hunting with a rock band.Strange did not believe in violence, except possibly in regard to chickens. He couldn't stand chickens. If a chicken walked by his house, Strange wouldrush out in a rage and tell the bird off and maybe even cuff it around a bit in the manner of early Bogart or Cagney. "You stupid chicken, don't ever let me catch you in dis neighborhood again, you hear?"Some of our neighbors kept half-starved timber wolves for watchdogs. Occasionally one of these beasts would come loping warily through our yard and encounter Strange. Since Strange considered the whole world as his territory, he fel =no particular obligation to defend this small portion of it. He would sit there, figuratively picking his teeth with a match, and stare insolently at the wolf, who was four times his size, its lip curled over glistening fangs, hackles raised, growls rumbling up from its belly. After a bit, the wolf would circle Strange, back away, and then lope on, occasionally casting a nervous glance back over its shoulder. "Punk!" Strange would mutter. Probably the reason none of these wolves ever attacked Strange was that they figured he was carrying a switchblade and maybe a blackjack.Despite the peculiar passive side to his character, Strange did commit a single act of violence that was so terrible my mother actually considered selling the farm and moving us all to town. At the very least, she said, she was getting rid of Strange.The episode began one warm spring evening when my grandmother sighted a skunk scurrying under our woodshed."He's probably the one that's been killing our chickens," Gram said. "I wouldn't be surprised but that he has his missus under there and they're planning a family. We'll be overrun with skunks!""Well, we'll just have to get him out from under the woodshed," Mom said. "Land sakes, a person can scarcely get a breath of fresh air in the backyard without smelling skunk. Maybe we should get Rancid Crabtree to come over and see what he can do about it.""He'd certainly overpower the skunk smell," Gram said, "but I don't see that's any gain.""What I mean is," Mom said, "maybe Rancid could trap the skunk or at least get it to leave. It's worth a try.""I don't know," Gram said. "It just doesn't seem like a fair contest to me.""Because Rancid uses guns and traps?" I asked."No, because the skunk has a brain!"Gram and Rancid were not fond of each other.The next day I was sent to tell Rancid we needed his expertise in extracting a skunk from under our woodshed. His face brightened at this news."Ha!" he said. "Thet ol' woman couldn't figureout how to git a skonk out from under yore shed, so fust thang she does is start yelling fer ol' Crabtree! If thet don't beat all!""Actually, it was Mom who told me to come get you," I said."Oh. Wall, in thet case, Ah'll come. Jist keep the ol' woman outta ma ha'r."When we arrived, Gram was standing out by the woodshed banging on a pot with a steel spoon and whooping and hollering. The old woodsman nudged me in the ribs and winked. I could tell he was going to get off one of his "good ones.""Would you mind practicin' your drummin' and singin' somewhar else?" Rancid said to her. "Me and the boy got to git a skonk out from under thet shed."If Gram could have given the skunk the same look she fired at Rancid, the creature would have been stunned if not killed outright. The glare had no effect on Rancid, however, since he was bent over laughing and slapping his knee in appreciation of his good one. It was, in fact, one of the best good ones I'd ever heard him get off, but I didn't dare laugh."All right, Bob Hope," Gram snapped. "Let's see how you get the skunk out from under there. Maybe if you stood upwind of it, that would do the trick!""Don't rile me, ol' woman, don't rile me," Rancid said. "Now, boy, go fetch me some newspapers. Ah'm gonna smoke thet critter outta thar.""And burn down the shed most likely," Gram said."Ha!" Rancid said. "You thank Ah don't know how to smoke a skonk out from under a shed?"Fortunately, the well and a bucket were close at hand and we were able to douse the fire before it did any more damage than blackening one corner of the building.During these proceedings, Strange had emerged from his house and sat looking on with an air of bemusement. There was nothing he loved better than a ruckus."Maybe we should just let the skunk be," Mom said."Land sakes, yes!" Gram shouted at Rancid. "Before you destroy the whole dang farm!"Rancid snorted. "No skonk's ever bested me yet, and this ain't gonna be the fust!"After each failed attempt to drive out the skunk, Rancid seemed to become angrier and more frenzied. Furiously, he dug a hole on one side of the shed. Then he jammed a long pole in through the hole and flailed wildly about with it. No luck. He went inside the shed and jumped up and downon the floor with his heavy boots. Still no skunk emerged. At one point, he tried to crawl under the shed, apparently with the idea of entering into hand-to-gland combat with the skunk, but the shed floor was too low to the ground. Then he grabbed up the pole and flailed it wildly under the floor again. Next he dropped the pole and yelled at me, "Go git another batch of newspapers!""No, no, no!" screamed Mom."Leave the poor skunk alone," Gram yelled. "I'm startin' to become fond of the little critter!"Rancid stood there panting and mopping sweat from his forehead with his arm. "Ah know what Ah'll do, Ah'll set a trap fer him! Should of did thet in the fust place. No skonk is gonna ..."At that moment, the skunk, no doubt taking advantage of the calm, or perhaps frightened by it, ran out from under the shed and made for the nearby brush."Ah figured thet little trick would work," Rancid said, although no one else was quite sure which trick he was speaking of. "And this way, there ain't no big stank, which is how Ah planned it."Then Strange tore into the skunk.The battle was short but fierce, with the skunk expending its whole arsenal as Strange dragged it about the yard, up the porch and down, into thewoodshed and out, and through the group of frantically dispersing spectators. At last, coming to his senses, the dog dropped the skunk and allowed it to stagger off into the bushes.Strange seemed embarrassed by his first and only display of heroism. "I don't know what came over me," he said, shaking. "I've got nothing against skunks!" Still, I couldn't help but be proud of him.The skunk was gone, but its essence lingered on. The air was stiff with the smell of skunk for weeks afterwards."That dog has got to go," Mom said. But, of course, Strange refused to go, and that was that.It was years before Strange was entirely free of the skunk odor. Every time he got wet, the smell came back in potent force."Phew!" a new friend of mine would say. "That your dog?""Yeah," I'd say, proudly, "he's a skunk dog."<i>Collection copyright � 1996 by Patrick F.

Both elegiac and erotic, <b>A Widow for One Year </b>is a multilayered love story of astonishing emotional force.</p><p>John Irving's <i>A Widow For One Year</i> is the epic story of a family, dysfunctional at best, unable to cope with tragedy--or with each other. The unabridged audiobook, narrated by George Guidall (<i>The Cat Who Sang for the Birds</i>, <i>The Inner Sanctum</i>, <i>The Legacy</i>) draws the listener in with a crisp, methodical vocal presentation. Guidall portrays each character with a convincingly distinct voice, accurately impersonating the characters' intonations and verbal habits. The interaction between characters is both conversational and believable.<p> We first meet Ruth Cole in the summer of 1958 when she walks in on her mother having sex with 16-year-old Eddie O'Hare, the assistant to Ruth's alcoholic father. The death of Ruth's older brothers (years before she was born) turns her mother, Marion, into a zombie who is unable to love her surviving daughter. Ted Cole is a semisuccessful writer and illustrator of disturbingly creepy children's novels. His womanizing habits prove he's "as deceitful as a damaged condom," but he remains the only stable figure in Ruth's life. The tempestuous tale fast-forwards to the year 1990 when Ruth's soaring writing career is faring far better than her lackluster love life. The final segment of the novel ends in 1995 when 41-year-old Ruth is ready to fall in love for the first time.</p><p> This profoundly absorbing story expresses the depths of misery and the healing power of love. Irving writes as a true storyteller, and Guidall executes the narrative with vigor and enthusiasm. (Running time: 24.5 hours, 14 cassettes) <i>--Gina Kaysen</i></p>Ruth Cole is a complex, often self-contradictory character--a "difficult" woman. By no means is she conventionally "nice," but she will never be forgotten. <br>Ruth's story is told in three parts, each focusing on a crucial time in her life. When we first meet her--on Long Island, in the summer of 1958--Ruth is only four. <br>The second window into Ruth's life opens in the fall of 1990, when Ruth is an unmarried woman whose personal life is not nearly as successful as her literary career. She distrusts her judgment in men, for good reason. <br>A Widow for One Year closes in the autumn of 1995, when Ruth Cole is a forty-one-year-old widow and mother. She's about to fall in love for the first time. <br>Richly comic, as well as deeply disturbing A Widow for One Year is a multilayered love story of astonishing emotional force. Both ribald and erotic, it is also a brilliant novel about the passage of time and the relentlessness of grief.</p><h2>Too Many Tamales</h2><p>Christmas Eve will be ruined if Maria doesn&#39;t find Mama&#39;s ring?

It's packed with more than two hundred vivid, original photographs of both classic and unusual Georgian architecture. <p>Students and general readers interested in architecture, art and design, as well as social, political and local history, will find themselves entranced by the unique beauty of each incredible piece.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Village on Horseback: Prose and Verse, 2003-2008</h2><p><i>The Village on Horseback</i> features mesmerizing new work from the author of <i>Samedi the Deafness</i> and <i>The Way Through Doors,</i> one of the <i>New Yorker&#x2019;s</i> Best Books of 2009. This collection of new pieces by experimental writer Jesse Ball is a philosophical recasting of myth and legend. Unearthing parables from the compost heap of oral tradition, folklore, literature, and popular culture, <i>The Village on Horseback</i> can be read as a sort of fabulist&#x2019;s compendium by an author who has been called charming, lyrical, fanciful, and "disturbingly original."</p><p></p><h2>Dominion Theology: Blessing or Curse? An Analysis of Christian Reconstructionism</h2><p>A movement is afoot within the evangelical church-a radical and alarming shift from some of the basic beliefs and practices of contemporary evangelical understanding. This movement-variously identified as dominion theology or Christian Reconstructionism-argues for a way of thinking about God&#39;s law, his plan for the future, and the role of the church fundamentally different from that commonly accepted among evangelicals. Reconstructionism cannot be dismissed as a passing, and therefore irrelevant, side-current on the course of evangelical thought. Reconstructionists have garnered support from such disparate groups as old-time fundamentals, charismatics, and some members of the evangelical intelligentsia. This book examines the history, goals, and beliefs of the Christian Reconstruction movement and its implications for the church and society. The authors&#39; careful evaluation uncovers the movement&#39;s strengths as well as its undeniable dangers. Christian Reconstructionism&#39;s radical proposals-including the stoning of rebellious adolescents, capital punishment for homosexuals, and the elimination of political pluralism-combined with its growing influence evoke one conclusion: Christian Reconstructionism must be carefully scrutinized by Christians concerned about the church&#39;s, and America&#39;s, future</p><p></p><h2>How Full Is Your Bucket?

He's cool. Reliable. A real pro: the hit man's hit man. The inconvenient wife, the aging sports star, the business partner, the retiree with a substantial legacy. He's taken care of them all, quietly and efficiently. </p><p>Keller's got a code of honor, though he'd never call it that. And he keeps the job strictly business. "What happens is you wind up thinking of each subject not as a person to be killed but as a problem to be solved. Now there are guys doing this who cope with it by making it personal. They find a reason to hate the guy they have to kill. I don't know what's a sin and what isn't, or if one person deserves to go on living and another deserves to have his life ended. Sometimes I think about stuff like that, but as far as working it all out in my mind, well, I never seem to get anywhere."</p><p>But while Keller might be a pragmatic and crack assassin, he's also prone to doubts and loneliness just like everybody else. There was a psychotherapist once. A dog. Even a woman. And though he's got Dot, his wisecracking contact and sometimes confidante, and his precious stamp collection, these days, it doesn't seem to be enough.</p><p>Keller's been at this business a long while. Just maybe it's time to pack it in and find a nice little house in the desert. Only problem is, retirement takes money. And to get money, he's got to go to work. . . . </p><p><em>Hit Parade</em>, the third novel featuring the fascinating Keller, displays the hallmarks that distinguish Lawrence Block's award-winning fiction: the intelligence, the clever plotting, the humor, the tricky twists and ironic turns, the darkness and emotional complexity -- and, above all else, the humanity.</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre. He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the Diamond Dagger from the British Crime Writers' Association&#x2014;only the third American to be given this award. He is a prolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short stories, and is a devoted New Yorker and an enthusiastic global traveler.</p>The prolific and successful Block returns as writer and narrator of another series of yarns about hit man John Keller. Block should not give up his word processor. He's a much better writer than reader. After just a few minutes, his croaky monotone makes you want to shut down the CD for good. But his stories about Keller's adventures are so entertaining in themselves that you plod on. For example, you learn what happens when Keller is hired to kill a millionaire's ferocious dog, which is killing other animals in Central Park. The irony in Block's performance is that once each story is over, Block's voice, in retrospect, doesn't seem all that bad.

It wasn&#x2019;t until 1951, while searching for books to read to his young son, Fritz, that he began writing children&#x2019;s stories. His classic Tales of Magic series started with the best-selling <i>Half Magic,</i> published in 1954. In each of his books he carefully acknowledges his indebtedness to E. Nesbit, whom he considered the best children&#x2019;s writer of all time&#x2014;&#x201c;so that any child who likes my books and doesn&#x2019;t know hers may be led back to the master of us all.&#x201d;&#x201c;Lots of fun.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "This latest book by the inventive and highly literate Mr. Eager is by all odds his best. The characters . . . are so alive they seem to step right out of the pages."&nbsp;<i> &#x2015;Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>Monadology and Sociology</h2><p>Gabriel Tarde&#39;s Monadology and Sociology, originally published in 1893, is a remarkable and unclassifiable book. It sets out a theory of &#39;universal sociology&#39;, which aims to explicate the essentially social nature of all phenomena, including the behaviour of atoms, stars, chemical substances and living beings. He argues that all of nature consists of elements animated by belief and desire, which form social aggregates analogous to those of human societies and institutions. In developing this central insight, Tarde outlines a metaphysical system which builds on both classical rationalist philosophy and the latest scientific theories of the time, in a speculative synthesis of extraordinary range and power. Tarde&#39;s work has only recently returned to prominence after a long eclipse. His work was an important influence on later theorists including Deleuze and Latour, and has been widely discussed in the social sciences, but has rarely been a focus of philosophical interest. The translator&#39;s afterword provides an explication of the key ideas in the text and situates Tarde&#39;s theory within the context of the philosophical tradition, arguing for the importance of the text as a highly original work of systematic ontology, and for its importance for contemporary theoretical debates.</p><p></p><h2>Adventures at Sea in the Great Age of Sail: Five Firsthand Narratives</h2><p>"On March 19th, 1790, I sailed on board the ship <i>Massachusetts,</i> Captain Job Prince, commander, bound on a voyage to Canton in China. . . . She excited a considerable sensation for she was the largest merchant vessel built at that time in the United States."<br>Thus begins the narrative of John Bartlett of Boston, one of five fascinating true stories in this thrilling anthology of adventure on the high seas, edited by Captain Elliot Snow of the United States Navy. These rare firsthand accounts, among the only such tales still extant, re-create in remarkable detail the exciting post&#x2012;Revolutionary War era when American sailing ships explored the seven seas and transformed a young nation into a maritime power.<br>John Bartlett's exciting narrative goes on to relate many unusual experiences: he bartered with Indians along the Alaskan coast; narrowly escaped capture in the Pacific Islands where Captain Cook was killed twelve years before; killed sea lions in the Indian Ocean, chased whales in the Mozambique Channel, and at last disappeared from sight while a "pressed" sailor in the British Navy.<br>During the War of 1812, Captain Charles Barnard sailed to the Falkland Islands where he rescued a shipwrecked British captain and crew who then seized his vessel. He was abandoned to survive, as best he could, on an uninhabited island and lived there for two years, a real-life Robinson Crusoe. His account of this and other adventures is one of the rarest narratives of American voyages.<br>Other exciting tales in this volume include that of Captain John B. Knights, master of the brig <i>Spy</i> out of Salem, Massachusetts, who had sailed to the South Pacific where he bartered for tortoise shells with the savage islanders of that region. His observations on native life in New Zealand and in the Fijis are of unusual interest.<br>For anyone in search of authentic tales of sea-going action, adventure, and exploration, these true-to-life accounts comprise a rich treasury of entertaining reading, with enough excitement and derring-do to satisfy any armchair adventurer. Moreover, they offer a vivid picture of life aboard the "tall ships" a century and more ago. A selection of 33 reproductions of historic drawings, engravings, and photographs add special flavor and authenticity to the text.</p><p></p><h2>Running from Safety: An Adventure of the Spirit</h2><p>Fifty years after promising--and forgetting--to come back through time and teach himself what he has learned about life, Richard meets nine-year-old Dickie Bach, who reminds him of the promise</p><p><p>A half-mile up, suspended by nylon wings and the promise of good lift, lifehanges on a pledge.

He lives in Tampa, FL. </p>Certifiable nutcase Serge Storms and Lenny, his spacey marijuana-addicted sidekick, are back again in Dorsey's sixth screwball crime-spree novel (after The Stingray Shuffle), this time on the trail of a stash of missing gems. As the novel begins, Serge escapes from Chattahoochee, Florida's state psychiatric hospital, and heads for Miami, obsessed with the idea of clearing up the mystery surrounding his grandfather's alleged suicide, which is tied to the legendary dozen diamonds still missing after Murph the Surf's infamous 1964 jewel heist from the Museum of Natural History. Serge's ambitious crusade gets off to an ill-omened start when he awakens the interest of both the mob and the Feds after getting into a graveside altercation with Tony Marsicano, the mob boss who was alone at the deathbed of Rico Spagliosi, a deceased fence reputed to have a part in the jewel heist. In a typical display of off-the-wall buffoonery, Serge starts a specialty Miami tour service, and his first booking is a group of drunken salesmen who, out to play a practical joke on a colleague, mistakenly kidnap Tony, with dire results. Sporadically moving back and forth between time present and nostalgic flashbacks to Miami Beach in the 1960s, the novel chronicles the methodical murders of Serge's grandfather's old cronies as Serge tracks his grandfather's movements at the time of the infamous gem heist and the return of the most famous of the stolen stones. Studded with psychosocial observations and dopey gags, this latest episode of Florida's hottest helter-skelter, hallucinogenic freak show will delight legions of Dorsey fans. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He first gained national recognition in 1934 when his bawdy painting <i>The Fleet's In!</i> was barred from a Public Works of Art exhibition in Washington, D.C. For more than six decades following, Cadmus led a career as a meticulous craftsman devoted to Renaissance-era traditions of figurative realism. But his drawings of the male nude, which always formed the heart of his work, were often overlooked.<br><br>Here for the first time in one volume are seventy of Cadmus's most stunning tributes to the male form. Cadmus continued to produce these works up until his death at age ninety-four, and this volume includes many drawings that have never been seen before. The artist's most frequent model was his lifelong partner Jon Anderson, and the drawings offer up not just an elegant fluency and technical virtuosity but also a tender emotional resonance. Introducing each era of the artist's career is an illustrated essay by respected critic and writer Justin Spring, placing Cadmus in the context of the rich history of the male nude.<br><br>Paul Cadmus reminds us-- poignantly, eloquently, humbly-- of the sincere beauty of the male form and of humanity itself with each masterful rendering. As Guy Davenport wrote in <i>The Drawings of Paul Cadmus</i>, "His drawings of male nudes are of bodies, but of achieved, perfected bodies that serve as symbols, as in ancient Greece, of a perfect unity of spirit and flesh, mind and body. For Cadmus the body<i> is </i>the person."<br></p><p><b>Justin Spring</b>, a 2001-2002 Guggenheim Fellow, who has written many monographs and catalogues on twentieth-century art, is a frequent contributor to <i>Artforum International</i> and is the author, most recently, of the biography<i> Fairfield Porter: A Life in Art</i>, which was hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as "exhaustive and intimate...a valuable addition to the intellectual histories of New York School painting and poetry."<br>Coming off the success of Fairfield Porter: A Life in Art, a wonderfully judicious biography of the iconoclastic mid-20th century figurative painter, Spring, a critic and journalist, returns to introduce six decades of determined realist Cadmus&#x2019;s Apollonian drawings, comprising a recent exhibition at New York&#x2019;s DC Moore gallery. Cadmus, who died in 1999 at 94, studied academic drawing beginning at age 15, and Spring convincingly links him to artists ranging from Carracci and Ingres to Alta-Tadema, Eakins and Cadmus&#x2019;s contemporary and lover Jared French. In a biographical narrative drawing on Cadmus&#x2019;s letters, artist&#x2019;s statements and unpublished interviews, Spring does an excellent job in delineating the context Cadmus created for himself, as an artist not so much opposed to the abstraction dominant for most of his career as indifferent to it. The 70 drawings here&#x2014;done in chalk, crayon, pencil and watercolor, pencil and charcoal, and egg tempera, and often on hand-toned paper&#x2014;speak for themselves: their lines are classically confident and fluid in a way that acknowledges but does not seek to stress the figures&#x2019; homoerotic allure, and their depiction of well-sculpted men in a variety of poses reveals a variety of affects, from contemplative to fearful to exultant. Many of the post-1962 drawings feature Cadmus&#x2019;s life partner Jon Anderson, whose gaze at the viewer in a 1967 drawing is even and open. Spring&#x2019;s care and feeling in presenting the drawings for the first time as a coherent body of work (apart from Cadmus&#x2019;s paintings) will make this book attractive to anyone with an interest in 20th century art and culture. 120 illustrations, 70 in full color.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Complete Dictionary of Symbols : In Myth, Art and Literature</h2><p>The Ultimate Desktop Dictionary Of Symbols, With More Than 2,000 Concise And Informative Entries Covering Classical And Other Mythologies, Biblical Themes And The World Of Traditional Symbols From Cultures Worldwide, The Complete Dictionary Of Symbols Is An Accessible Guide To More Than 2,000 Major Themes, Figures And Symbols That Have Been Most Commonly Encountered From Ancient Times To The Present Day.

He lives in the French Alps.This is the first symbols source to be labeled <i>complete</i>, although the introduction does not specify the qualities that make it so. Its 2,000 entries are twice the number found in other resources on the topic, such as Tresidder's 1998 <i>Dictionary of Symbols: An Illustrated Guide to Traditional Images, Icons, and Emblems</i> (much of which is duplicated in the newer book). The alphabetically arranged entries focus on classical and Christian symbolism but encompass other traditions worldwide. In addition to traditional symbols (e.g., objects, animals, flowers, shapes), the volume includes legends, themes, or concepts important for understanding systems of symbols and historical, mythological, or religious figures. It also includes brief references to the use of the symbol in art. For example, the entry <i>alchemy</i> is identical to that in the <i>Dictionary of Symbols</i> except for a reference to the depiction of alchemists in Vasari's painting <i>The Alchemist's Laboratory</i>. <i>The Complete Dictionary</i>'s articles range from a few sentences to one-page panels on more comprehensive topics (<i>Colours; Elements; Music, musical instruments</i>). Its format is similar to <i>Dictionary of Symbols</i>, with <i>see</i> references and sources placed awkwardly in the margins, where they might be missed. Bibliographical references are minimal; most cite only basic sources such as Psalms 42:1 for <i>Stag</i> or Pliny the Elder's <i>Natural History for Phoenix</i>. A geographically arranged bibliography at the end of the volume includes a good selection of older, classic texts on art, mythology, and religion.

Tour.</p><p>"Handing out advice on family matters is not my game," begins Calvin Trillin in <i>Family Man</i>, and indeed, those in search of practical child-rearing tips would be advised to look elsewhere. What Trillin does have to offer is a series of witty meditations on the art--<i>not</i> the science--of parenthood. Nobody else has written quite so accurately about the debunking genius of small children. And while Trillin conveys the joys and sorrows of family life with his customary drollness, what really gets him going is the high anxiety of being in loco parentis. When, for example, a study reveals that most of our synapses are formed during infancy, the author is nonplused by the scientific breakthrough. He's quick, though, to latch on to this new opportunity for self-flagellation: <blockquote> This business about the synapses struck me as the sort of finding that could have been designed to add to the concerns of those older parents who already spend some uncomfortable time, while trying to fall asleep at night, thinking of ways that they may have shortchanged their children. Here is an entirely new subject, pushing aside old chestnuts like whether that really was the right summer camp or whether the purchase of the guitar might have been to blame for everything that followed. Now, as they toss and turn, they can envision their children trying to compete in a global economy with reduced brainpower. </blockquote> This beleaguered dad does, it should be said, touch upon a handful of more general topics, including the wacky world of contemporary wedding ceremonies.

In 1942, 11-year-old Phillip Enright lives with his parents on the Dutch island of Cura�ao, but when the war moves too close for comfort, his mother decides to travel with him back to the safety of Virginia. When their boat is torpedoed, however, Phillip is blinded and finds himself adrift on a life raft with an old black man and a cat. They eventually land on a deserted island. Phillip is suspicious of "the large Negro," but soon grows to trust--and ultimately love--the patient and generous Timothy. Dedicated to "Dr. King's Dream," <i>The Cay</i> has a clear message that friendship is colorblind; it is also a terrific adventure story of a young, newly blinded man learning to survive on an uninhabited island.

But when Harlan meets and falls for a non-Eternal woman, he seeks to use the awesome powers and techniques of the Eternals to twist time for his own purposes, so that he and his love can survive together.</p><p>Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) was born in Russia and taken to America in 1923, becoming an American citizen in 1928. He took a degree in chemistry from Columbia University in 1939, and took his MA in 1941 and his PhD in 1948, after spending the war years in the Naval Air Experimental Station. He joined the Boston University School of Medicine in 1949, becoming associate professor of biochemistry. He is best known for the Robot and Foundation sequences.<p>1. TECHNICIAN</p><p>Andrew Harlan stepped into the kettle. Its sides were perfectly round and it fit snugly inside a vertical shaft composed of widely spaced rods that shimmered into an unseeable haze six feet above Harlan&#x2019;s head. Harlan set the controls and moved the smoothly working starting lever.</p><p>The kettle did not move.</p><p>Harlan did not expect it to. He expected no movement; neither up nor down, left nor right, forth nor back. Yet the spaces between the rods had melted into a gray blankness which was solid to the touch, though nonetheless immaterial for all that. And there was the little stir in his stomach, the faint (psychosomatic?) touch of dizziness, that told him that all the kettle contained, including himself, was rushing upwhen through Eternity.</p><p>He had boarded the kettle in the 575th Century, the base of operations assigned him two years earlier. At the time the 575th had been the farthest upwhen he had ever traveled. Now he was moving upwhen to the 2456th Century.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances he might have felt a little lost at the prospect. His native Century was in the far downwhen, the 95th Century, to be exact. The 95th was a Century stiffly restrictive of atomic power, faintly rustic, fond of natural wood as a structural material, exporters of certain types of distilled potables to nearly everywhen and importers of clover seed. Although Harlan had not been in the 95th since he entered special training and became a Cub at the age of fifteen, there was always that feeling of loss when one moved outwhen from "home." At the 2456th he would be nearly two hundred forty millennia from his birth when and that is a sizable distance even for a hardened Eternal.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances all this would be so.</p><p>But right now Harlan was in poor mood to think of anything but the fact that his documents were heavy in his pocket and tense, a little confused.</p><p>It was his hands acting by themselves that brought the kettle to the proper halt at the proper Century.</p><p>Strange that a Technician should feel tense or nervous about anything. What was it that Educator Yarrow had once said:</p><p>"Above all, a Technician must be dispassionate. The Reality Change he initiates may affect the lives of as many as fifty billion people. A million or more of these may be so drastically affected as to be considered new individuals. Under these conditions, an emotional make-up is a distinct handicap."</p><p>Harlan put the memory of his teacher&#x2019;s dry voice out of his mind with an almost savage shake of his head. In those days he had never imagined that he himself would have the peculiar talent for that very position. But emotion had come upon him after all. Not for fifty billion people. What in Time did he care for fifty billion people? There was just one. One person.</p><p>He became aware that the kettle was stationary and with the merest pause to pull his thoughts together, put himself into the cold, impersonal frame of mind a Technician must have, he stepped out. The kettle he left, of course, was not the same as the one he had boarded, in the sense that it was not composed of the same atoms. He did not worry about that any more than any Eternal would. To concern oneself with the mystique of Time-travel, rather than with the simple fact of it, was the mark of the Cub and newcomer to Eternity.</p><p>He paused again at the infinitely thin curtain of non-Space and non-Time which separated him from Eternity in one way and from ordinary Time in another.</p><p>This would be a completely new section of Eternity for him. He knew about it in a rough way, of course, having checked upon it in the Temporal Handbook. Still, there was no substitute for actual appearance and he steeled himself for the initial shock of adjustment.</p><p>He adjusted the controls, a simple matter in passing into Eternity (and a very complicated one in passing into Time, a type of passage which was correspondingly less frequent). He stepped through the curtain and found himself squinting at the brilliance. Automatically he threw up his hand to shield his eyes.</p><p>Only one man faced him. At first Harlan could see him only blurrily.</p><p>The man said, "I am Sociologist Kantor Voy. I imagine you are Technician Harlan."</p><p>Harlan nodded and said, "Father Time! Isn&#x2019;t this sort of ornamentation adjustable?"</p><p>Voy looked about and said tolerantly, "You mean the molecular films?"</p><p>"I certainly do," said Harlan. The Handbook had mentioned them, but had said nothing of such an insane riot of light reflection.</p><p>Harlan felt his annoyance to be quite reasonable. The 2456th Century was matter-oriented, as most Centuries were, so he had a right to expect a basic compatibility from the very beginning. It would have none of the utter confusion (for anyone born matter-oriented) of the energy vortices of the 300&#x2019;s, or the field dynamics of the 600&#x2019;s. In the 2456th, to the average Eternal&#x2019;s comfort, matter was used for everything from walls to tacks.</p><p>To be sure, there was matter and matter. A member of an energy-oriented Century might not realize that. To him all matter might seem minor variations on the theme that was gross, heavy, and barbaric. To matter-oriented Harlan, however, there was wood, metal (subdivisions, heavy and light), plastic, silicates, concrete, leather, and so on.</p><p>But matter consisting entirely of mirrors!</p><p>That was his first impression of the 2456th. Every surface reflected and glinted light. Everywhere was the illusion of complete smoothness; the effect of a molecular film. And in the ever-repeated reflection of himself, of Sociologist Voy, of everything he could see, in scraps and wholes, in all angles, there was confusion. Garish confusion and nausea!</p><p>"I&#x2019;m sorry," said Voy, "it&#x2019;s the custom of the Century, and the Section assigned to it finds it good practice to adopt the customs where practical. You get used to it after a time."</p><p>Voy walked rapidly upon the moving feet of another Voy, upside down beneath the floor, who matched him stride for stride. He reached to move a hair-contact indicator down a spiral scale to point of origin.</p><p>The reflections died; extraneous light faded. Harlan felt his world settle.</p><p>"If you&#x2019;ll come with me now," said Voy.</p><p>Harlan followed through empty corridors that, Harlan knew, must moments ago have been a riot of made light and reflection, up a ramp, through an anteroom, into an office.</p><p>In all the short journey no human being had been visible. Harlan was so used to that, took it so for granted, that he would have been surprised, almost shocked, if a glimpse of a human figure hurrying away had caught his eyes. No doubt the news had spread that a Technician was coming through. Even Voy kept his distance and when, accidentally, Harlan&#x2019;s hand had brushed Voy&#x2019;s sleeve, Voy shrank away with a visible start.</p><p>Harlan was faintly surprised at the touch of bitterness he felt at this. He had thought the shell he had grown about his soul was thicker, more efficiently insensitive than that. If he was wrong, if his shell had worn thinner, there could only be one reason for that.</p><p>No�s!</p><p>Sociologist Kantor Voy leaned forward toward the Technician in what seemed a friendly enough fashion, but Harlan noted automatically that they were seated on opposite sides of the long axis of a fairly large table.</p><p>Voy said, "I am pleased to have a Technician of your reputation interest himself in our little problem here."</p><p>"Yes," said Harlan with the cold impersonality people would expect of him. "It has its points of interest." (Was he impersonal enough? Surely his real motives must be apparent, his guilt be spelled out in beads of sweat on his forehead.)</p><p>He removed from an inner pocket the foiled summary of the projected Reality Change. It was the very copy which had been sent to the Allwhen Council a month earlier. Through his relationship with Senior Computer Twissell (the Twissell, himself) Harlan had had little trouble in getting his hands on it.</p><p>Before unrolling the foil, letting it peel off onto the table top where it would be held by a soft paramagnetic field, Harlan paused a split moment.</p><p>The molecular film that covered the table was subdued but was not zero. The motion of his arm fixed his eye and for an instant the reflection of his own face seemed to stare somberly up at him from the tabletop. He was thirty-two, but he looked older. He needed no one to tell him that. It might be partly his long face and dark eyebrows over darker eyes that gave him the lowering expression and cold glare associated with the caricature of the Technician in the minds of all Eternals. It might be just his own realization that he was a Technician.</p><p>But then he flicked the foil out across the table and turned to the matter at hand.</p><p>"I am not a Sociologist, sir."</p><p>Voy smiled. "That sounds formidable. When one begins by expressing lack of competence in a given field, it usually implies that a flat opinion in that field will follow almost immediately."</p><p>"No," said Harlan, "not an opinion. Just a request. I wonder if you won&#x2019;t look over this summary and see if you haven&#x2019;t made a small mistake somewhere here."</p><p>Voy looked instantly grave. "I hope not," he said.</p><p>Harlan kept one arm across the back of his chair, the other in his lap. He must let neither hand drum restless fingers. He must not bite his lips. He must not show his feelings in any way.</p><p>Ever since the whole orientation of his life had so changed itself, he had been watching the summaries of projected Reality Changes as they passed through the grinding administrative gears of the Allwhen Council. As Senior Computer Twissell&#x2019;s personally assigned Technician, he could arrange that by a slight bending of professional ethics. Particularly with Twissell&#x2019;s attention caught ever more tightly in his own overwhelming project. (Harlan&#x2019;s nostrils flared. He knew now a little of the nature of that project.)</p><p>Harlan had had no assurance that he woul...</p></p><h2>Glider Basics from Solo to License</h2><p>From author&#39;s Preface - This is the first book written expressly for the power pilot who is going to transition to gliders.

Barlaam and Josaphat (Ioasaph) were believed to have re-converted India after her lapse from conversion to Christianity, and they were numbered among the Christian saints. Centuries ago likenesses were noticed between the life of Josaphat and the life of the Buddha; the resemblances are in incidents, doctrine, and philosophy, and Barlaam's rules of abstinence resemble the Buddhist monk's. But not till the mid-nineteenth century was it recognised that, in Josaphat, the Buddha had been venerated as a Christian saint for about a thousand years.</p><p>The origin of the story of Barlaam and Ioasaph&#x2014;which in itself has little peculiar to Buddhism&#x2014;appears to be a Manichaean tract produced in Central Asia. It was welcomed by the Arabs and by the Georgians. The Greek romance of Barlaam appears separately first in the 11th century. Most of the Greek manuscripts attribute the story to John the Monk, and it is only some later scribes who identify this John with John Damascene (ca. 676&#x2013;749). There is strong evidence in Latin and Georgian as well as Greek that it was the Georgian Euthymius (who died in 1028) who caused the story to be translated from Georgian into Greek, the whole being reshaped and supplemented. The Greek romance soon spread throughout Christendom, and was translated into Latin, Old Slavonic, Armenian, and Arabic.

His books include the best sellers Norman Rockwell&#39;s America, The Art of Walt Disney, and Rainbow, a biography of Judy Garland, which was turned into a film.

He sold his first cover paintings when there were still horse-drawn cabs on the streets of many American cities, and he began his association with <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> in 1916, the year in which Woodrow Wilson was elected to a second term in the White House and the year in which Chaplin's movie <i>The Floorwalker</i> broke box office records across the country. Young women were enjoying the comparative freedom of ankle-length skirts, and their beaux were serenading them with such immortal ditties as The Sunshine of Your Smile&#x201d; and Yackie Hacki Wicki Wackie Woo.&#x201d; In literature this was the age of Booth Tarkington, Edith Wharton, and O. Henry. Ernest Hemingway, still in his teens, was a cub reporter for the <i>Kansas City Star,</i> and F. Scott Fitzgerald soon to become a frequent contributor to the <i>Post</i> was still at Princeton. The New York Armory show of 1913 had introduced the American public to recent trends in European painting, but traditional values still reigned supreme in the American art world. Only a handful of artists aspired to anything more novel than the mild postimpressionism of painters like John Sloan and Maurice Prendergast. The movies were becoming a potent force in popular entertainment, but few people took them seriously or thought they might one day take their place alongside established art forms.<br> <br>It was a world in transition, but the transition had not yet accelerated to the giddy speed it would achieve in the twenties. People could be thrilled by the exploits of pioneer aviators without being conscious of the impact that flying machines would have on modern warfare. It was possible to enjoy the conveniences provided by such relatively new inventions as the telephone, the phonograph, the vacuum cleaner, and the automobile without being too troubled by the notion that technology might someday soon threaten the established order of things.<br> <br>The illustrator and cover artist working in the mid-teens of the twentieth century was generally asked to embody established values. The latest model Hupmobile Runabout might well be the subject of a given picture an advertisement, perhaps but the people who were shown admiring or driving in the newfangled vehicle were presumed to espouse the same values as their parents and their grandparents. The set of the jaw, the glint in the eye had not changed much since the middle of the nineteenth century. The women wore their hair a little differently, perhaps, and men were doing without beards, but these are superficial differences. The fact is that the minds of the people who edited and bought magazines like <i>Colliers, Country Gentleman, Literary Digest,</i> and <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> had been formed, to a large extent, in the Victorian era.<br> <br>Norman Rockwell himself, born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, had a classic late Victorian upbringing. He spent his childhood in a solidly middle-class, God-fearing household in which it was the custom for his father to read the works of Dickens out loud to the entire family. Thus Rockwell had little difficulty in adapting to the conventions that were current in the field of magazine illustration at the outset of his career. Although a New Yorker, he was especially drawn to rural subject matter (he is on record as saying that he felt more at home in the country). This reinforced his affection for traditional idioms, since it focused his attention on the most conservative elements of the population, those who were least susceptible to change of any kind.<br> <br>In short, Rockwell began his career right in the mainstream of the illustrators of his day, sharing the assumptions and concerns of his contemporaries and of the editors who employed him. His work is remarkable because he sustained through half a century the values that he espoused in those early days when the world was changing more drastically than anyone could have imagined possible. It would be easy enough, of course, to find fault with his refusal to break with those values, but that would be unjust. Rockwell simply continued to believe in what he had always believed in, and in his own way, he did, in fact, change and grow throughout his career. He learned how to embrace the modern age without abandoning his own principles. But he was also forced to modify and enrich his approach to the art of illustration in order to reconcile those principles to a world that was evolving so fast it seemed, at times, on the verge of flying apart.<br> <br>His earliest paintings are conventional, almost to the point of banality, because the values they embody could be taken so much for granted. As he was forced to deal with a changing environment, however, he was obliged to become more inventive and original. A situation that could be presented in the simplest of terms in 1916, for example, might still be valid a quarter of a century later, but only if it were made more specific. Stereotypes had to be replaced by carefully individualized characters. More and more detail had to be introduced to make a situation more particular. As time passed, Rockwell was called upon to draw on all his resources as an illustrator in order to put his audience which was always changing along with him. As circumstances became, theoretically at least, more hostile to his kind of traditional image-making, he rose to the challenge. His work became richer and more resonant, reaching a peak in the forties and fifties when most of the men who had been his rivals at the outset of his career were already long forgotten. His most remarkable quality was his ability to grow and adapt to remain flexible without ever modifying the basic tenets of his art.<br> <br>What seems to have enabled him to do this was a belief in the fundamental decency of the great majority of his fellow human beings. This belief was the most deep-seated of all his values, and it enabled him to perceive a continuity in behavior patterns undisturbed by shifts in social mores. The twentieth century has offered plenty of evidence of man's ability to shed his humanity, and Rockwell was certainly aware of this, yet he clung to his belief and decency. It was an article of faith, and it gave his work its particular flavor of innocence.<br> <br>Over the past hundred years or so, artists and critics have been ambiguous in their attitudes toward innocence. The "naive" vision of such painters as Henri Rousseau has been much prized, yet more schooled artists have often been led astray when they attempted to embrace such a vision (indeed it would be difficult for such a vision to survive schooling). Picasso, the most protean of all twentieth-century artists greatly admired by Rockwell, it should be noted was able to run the full gamut: from a childlike delight in transforming bicycle parts into the likeness of a bulls head to the nightmare vision of Guernica but Picasso was, in every way, an exception to the rules.<br> <br>Rockwell's art has nothing, of course, to do with the innovations of modern painting. He was essentially a popular artist an entertainer and he was always fully aware that his work was intended to be seen in reproduction. The originals generally painted on a relatively large scale are, however, beautiful objects in their own right. He was looking to the general public rather than to a small, highly informed audience, and it was this perhaps that enabled him to sustain the innocence of his vision. Dealing with mass communication rather than the higher reaches of aesthetic decision-making, he has no place in the developing pattern of art history. It is futile even to compare him with American realists like Edward Hopper, whose subject matter occasionally had something in common with Rockwell's. Hopper was always concerned primarily with plastic values, as is the case with any "pure" painter. Rockwell, on the other hand, had to think first and foremost about conveying information about his subject, as must be the case with any illustrator. An illustrator may, of course, have many of the same skills as the "pure" painter, but he deploys them in a different way. Essentially he borrows from existing idioms of easel painting whether traditional, as in Norman Rockwell's case, or more experimental, as was the case with his notable contemporary Rockwell Kent and uses them as a means of conveying information. Interestingly, it is known that Norman Rockwell himself, during the twenties, was drawn to modern idioms-the result of a sojourn in Paris but rejected them in favor of older conventions. The reason for this, we may suppose, was his recognition of the fact that his gift was not painterly at all (remarkable as his painterly skills were). It was, rather, his ability as a pictorial storyteller.<br> <br>Most of Rockwell's finest covers are, in effect, anecdotes. With occasional exceptions, he can give us only one scene an isolated episode but, in his mature work especially, he knows how to pack that scene with so much significant detail that the events that precede it, and follow from it, are, so to speak, latent in the single image. A great short story writer, like Guy de Maupassant, can conjure up a whole life within the span of a dozen pages. Rockwell, at his best, was capable of doing the same kind of thing with a single picture. Because of this he deserves to be thought of as something more than just an illustrator. An illustrator, by definition, is someone who takes another person's story (or advertising copy) and adds a visual dimension. Rockwell, in his cover art, went far beyond this. He was not only the illustrator, but also the author of the story. In his work, image and anecdote were inseparable; each sprang naturally from the other <br></p><h2>The End of the Days All the Prophetic Visions of Daniel Explained</h2><p>A classic prophetic book that is a comprehensive exposition of all the prophetic sections of the book of Daniel.</p><p>Arthur Bloomfield was a respected pastor in the Methodist Church and editor of Higley&#39;s Sunday School Commentary before devoting his time to studying, writing, and lecturing on Bible prophecy.

Bad wrong.</i></p><p><i>A rooster tail of scorched yellow earth kicked up as the pickup rounded the corner onto Vernon Dairy Road. I cut my eyes sideways at Mama, rigid behind the wheel, but bit my bottom lip to keep silent. I didn&#x2019;t like the look on her face, like she&#x2019;d just been told the Rapture was coming and she&#x2019;d been caught off guard. But mostly, she looked tired. Beneath the streaky traces of last night&#x2019;s powder, her face was pale and strained, her eyes puffy and red, though whether that was to do with tears or drink, I couldn&#x2019;t say.</i></p><p><i>Both, probably.</i></p><p><i>Beside me, Caroline was mute, huddled against the passenger-side armrest, her beloved rag doll, Chessie, clutched to her chest, wide green eyes fixed on some invisible point beyond the cracked windshield. Her hair was snarled from sleep, a coppery halo around her pale young face. We&#x2019;d barely gotten breakfast down&#x2014;milk and hunks of leftover corn bread&#x2014;before Mama shooed us from the table and out of the house.</i></p><p><i>I thought of the battered suitcase bumping around in the back of the truck, then tried not to think about it. I didn&#x2019;t want to remember the way Mama&#x2019;s eyes slid away from mine when I spotted it, or how the sleeve of my sister&#x2019;s blue dress had spilled out from one corner. There was something ominous about that sleeve, something ominous, too, in the way Mama had pressed that old hand-me-down doll into Caroline&#x2019;s hands as she herded us out the door and across the front yard, past the empty plastic swimming pool and the old tire swing Daddy put up the summer he went away for the last time.</i></p><p><i>Mama was quiet behind the wheel, her eyes hard on the road as it ground away beneath the tires, as if she&#x2019;d made up her mind about something and there was no going back. In her rumpled hat and too-tight dress she looked as threadbare as Caroline&#x2019;s old rag doll, like her stuffing might come loose any minute. Desperation. The word popped into my head without having to reach for it. It was written all over her face, coming off her like last night&#x2019;s bourbon.</i></p><p><i>We&#x2019;d been driving almost two hours, and I still hadn&#x2019;t scraped up the nerve to ask where we were going. Maybe because I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t like the answer. Or maybe because I couldn&#x2019;t think over the words echoing in my head.</i> Something&#x2019;s wrong. Something&#x2019;s wrong. <i>Not the regular kind of wrong, like when Daddy would disappear for weeks at a time, or Mama would lose another job because she didn&#x2019;t have money to put gas in the truck, but the really bad kind of wrong, like when Sheriff Cady had come to the door to say that Daddy wouldn&#x2019;t be coming back ever. Today felt like that kind of wrong&#x2014;the kind that changed things forever.</i></p><p><i>A fresh cloud of dust churned up from the road, boiling into the open windows, coating the dashboard with another layer of grit. We were passing an empty field of sun-bleached scrub, an ugly stretch of nothing that made me want to leap from the moving truck and run all the way home.</i> Turn around! <i>I wanted to yell at Mama.</i> Turn around and let&#x2019;s go home. <i>But I didn&#x2019;t. There were tears in her eyes now, and I couldn&#x2019;t bear the sight of Mama&#x2019;s tears.</i></p><p><i>The road narrowed to a single lane as we passed under a peeling wood sign. I had to squint to make out the letters: Mt. Zion Missionary Poor Farm.</i></p><p><i>Poor farm?</i></p><p><i>I shot Caroline a panicked look, but she just kept on staring straight ahead, her green eyes fixed on the narrow swath of dirt road. Either she hadn&#x2019;t seen the sign, or she didn&#x2019;t know what it meant. But I knew.</i></p><p><i>I knew money was tight, and had been for a while. We hadn&#x2019;t had milk in weeks, and more nights than not, dinner was nothing but corn bread and collards. But we&#x2019;d been through rough patches before and Mama always found a way. Sometimes, when she was between jobs, she would bring a man home from the Orchid Lounge. Sometimes he would even stay a few weeks. But there hadn&#x2019;t been any men for a while&#x2014;or any jobs, either.</i></p><p><i>Up ahead, a big white farmhouse shimmered into view against the hot blue sky. Beyond the house was a small whitewashed chapel, and beyond that was a scatter of smaller houses and outbuildings, all crisscrossed with a maze of split-rail fences. A handful of men milled about in overalls and dirty boots. A few looked up with dull eyes as the truck rattled up the circular drive and stopped in front of the house.</i></p><p><i>I sat stock-still while Mama climbed down out of the truck, then went around to drag the old suitcase out of the back. If I didn&#x2019;t move, if I didn&#x2019;t get out of the truck, maybe it would all go away. Or maybe if I said a prayer. But there was no time for prayers. Mama was coming around to the passenger side and opening the door. Caroline tumbled out obediently, Chessie dangling limply from the crook of her arm. I had no choice but to scoot across the sticky seat and follow my sister.</i></p><p><i>Mama pointed to the suitcase and then to Caroline, charging me with the care of both while she went inside to see to things. I thought I caught a whiff of bourbon on her breath. Last night&#x2019;s, I remember hoping, though I didn&#x2019;t think so. I watched as Mama mounted the porch steps and disappeared through the screen door with a soft slap. I couldn&#x2019;t say for sure what things she was going to see to, but I had a pretty good idea.</i></p><p><i>Poor farms were for people who couldn&#x2019;t feed themselves or their families, a place where grown-ups and children earned the food in their bellies and the roof over their heads by working in the fields. I had heard of such places, and what folks said about the people who went to them&#x2014;people willing to take a handout because they were too lazy or too dull-witted to find real work.</i></p><p><i>We would be those people now.</i></p><p><i>I eyed the old suitcase with a sick feeling, wondering how Mama had managed to pack three people&#x2019;s clothes into one small case. The thought filled my head with a low, dull buzz, like a swarm of irate bees, though I couldn&#x2019;t put my finger on why the thought kept nagging at me. It wasn&#x2019;t until I heard the screen door slap again, and looked up into those guilty green eyes&#x2014;eyes just like mine&#x2014;that I realized Mama had left the truck running.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>June 5, 1995</p><p>Manhattan</p><p>Lily barely registered the sound of her own name being spoken, jumbled together with a lot of legalese. The lawyer was doing his thing, parceling out her father&#x2019;s worldly goods like door prizes at an Amway rally&#x2014;stocks, bonds, corporate holdings. She didn&#x2019;t care. Not about those things.</p><p>She should have been there when he died. Instead she had lingered in Paris, working out the details of her next strategic career move&#x2014;a move that would land her at one of the hottest design houses in Milan. It didn&#x2019;t help that her mother had waited until the last possible moment to inform her that her father was seriously ill. Finalizing the details had taken only a day, but the delay had cost her dearly. She&#x2019;d been so busy trying to make her father proud that she&#x2019;d missed the chance to say good-bye.</p><p>And now, twenty-four hours after landing at JFK, she was sitting in Stephen Singer&#x2019;s Manhattan office, listening to the terms of Roland St. Claire&#x2019;s last will and testament. Except she wasn&#x2019;t really listening. Her mother was, though, with her signature blend of disappointment and disapproval stamped all over her perfectly powdered face. When it came to money and getting her due, Caroline St. Claire didn&#x2019;t miss a trick.</p><p>She had certainly dressed for the occasion, Lily noted frostily&#x2014;black Norma Kamali with gold buttons and a skirt just short enough to show off surprisingly good legs.</p><p><i>Widow couture?</i></p><p>Perhaps there was something to that. Perhaps her mother had inadvertently stumbled onto the signature niche that had been stubbornly eluding Lily all these years, despite fashion degrees from both Parsons and IFA, and nearly ten years at various Paris design houses.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss St. Claire?&#x201d;</p><p>Lily blinked, vaguely aware, as she stared at the sheaf of papers being pushed across the desk, that a response of some kind was expected. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, what?&#x201d;</p><p>Stephen Singer smiled, tapping the stack of pages with the flats of his fingers the way one might pat a puppy or child on the head. &#x201c;I was saying we&#x2019;ve come to the portion of your father&#x2019;s will that concerns you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yes. Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>She really didn&#x2019;t understand why they needed to sit through this. Her father&#x2019;s holdings, liquid or otherwise, were hardly a secret, at least not to anyone who read the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> or<i> Fortune </i>magazine. Nor was it likely she or her mother would ever starve. They were grieving&#x2014;or at least she was&#x2014;wearing black and sipping bad coffee while they pored over the man&#x2019;s portfolio, carving up things he&#x2019;d spent his life building. She just wanted it over.</p><p>Lily picked up the papers and placed them in her lap, not bothering to follow along as Mr. Singer started to read. It was mostly about her trust fund&#x2014;dollar amounts, dates of scheduled payouts. None of it interested her. She was staring out the window, at the smoggy stretch of Manhattan skyline, when a sharp intake of breath got her attention. Snapping her head around, she was surprised to see that the color had all but drained from her mother&#x2019;s cheeks.</p><p>&#x201c;That isn&#x2019;t possible,&#x201d; Caroline replied emphatically to whatever her father&#x2019;s attorney had just said. &#x201c;Roland hasn&#x2019;t owned that property for years.&#x201d;</p><p>Singer cleared his throat, adjusting himself uneasily in his high-backed leather chair. &#x201c;Mrs. St. Claire, you might not be aware that your husband reacquired the property last year. Your sister&#x2014;that is, Ms. Boyle&#x2014;bequeathed it to him upon her death. And now Roland has bequeathed it to your daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>Lily blinked at Singer, then turned to her mother. &#x201c;What property?&#x201d;</p><p>Caroline stared back as if she hadn&#x2019;t heard the question. Beneath all the carefully applied makeup, her face had suddenly gone the color of ash.</p><p>&#x201c;Mother?&#x201d;</p><p>Singer jumped in to fill the void when it became obvious that Caroline wouldn&#x2019;t answer. &#x201c;The property in question is Sand Pearl Cottage.&#x201d;</p><p>Lily ran the name around in her head but came up empty. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never heard of it.&#x201d;</p><p>He shot Caroline a pointed look before going on. &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t suppose you would have. It&#x2019;s down on the Gulf Coast of Florida, on a little spit of beach called Hideaway Key. It used to belong to your mother&#x2019;s sister.&#x201d; He paused briefly when Caroline opened her mouth to interrupt, sending her a quelling look. &#x201c;As I was saying, your aunt Lily-Mae owned the cottage for years, and then left it to your father. Now he&#x2019;s passed it on to you.&#x201d;</p><p>All of a sudden, Singer had her full attention. Lily-Mae Boyle had left her a cottage? &#x201c;Why me? I&#x2019;ve never laid eyes on the woman.&#x201d;</p><p>Singer&#x2019;s lips thinned. &#x201c;Yes, well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps that&#x2019;s why.&#x201d;</p><p>Lily tried to wrap her head around what she was being told, but she wasn&#x2019;t having much luck. For as long as she could remember, the name Lily-Mae Boyle had been forbidden in their home, an edict Lily-Mae&#x2019;s death, one year ago, had done nothing to change. And yet she had remained a part of their lives, a shadowy but palpable presence in the St. Claire household. It irked her that despite her thirty-year fascination with the exiled Lily-Mae, she still didn&#x2019;t understand the long-standing feud between her mother and her aunt. She only knew the sisters had sparred briefly for her father&#x2019;s affections, and that her mother had emerged the victor.</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d; Caroline&#x2019;s voice crackled in the silence. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a mistake. My daughter will not have anything to do with that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Caroline.&#x201d; Singer drew the name out on a sigh, as if addressing a headstrong child. &#x201c;Do I need to remind you that your daughter is well beyond the age of twenty-one? In fact, if memory serves, and you can trust me when I tell you it does, Lily will be thirty-six on her next birthday, which means you have absolutely no say&#x2014;in this or in anything else she might choose to do. Roland was very clear about her having the cottage. Period. Now, with your permission, I&#x2019;d like to move on to the final paperwork.&#x201d;</p><p>Caroline&#x2019;s chin came up a notch, as it always did when she didn&#x2019;t get her way, but she said nothing more.</p><p>� � �</p><p>&#xfffc;As Lily navigated the snarl of downtown traffic, she could barely recall the rest of the meeting, except that it had all been rather surreal. She had signed where she was told to sign, initialed where she was told to initial, and then dutifully accepted the paperwork Singer handed her as she left his office, including the key to a beach house that until two hours ago she hadn&#x2019;t known existed.</p><p>She was leaving for Milan in a few weeks. What was she supposed to do with a beach house? Although, at the moment, she had to admit the prospect of hiding out for a few weeks at a seaside cottage had its appeal. Just the thought of returning to her parents&#x2019; Gramercy town house made her squirm, especially now that her father was gone. Unfortunately, short of checking into a hotel, she had nowhere else to go. It hadn&#x2019;t made sense to hang on to her loft when she left for Paris. And she&#x2019;d been right. In nine years she&#x2019;d been home less than a dozen times, usually for Christmas, or her father&#x2019;s birthday. Now, she would have happily paid rent on an empty flat if it meant having a place to escape her mother&#x2019;s present mood, or for that matter, most of her moods.</p><p>Lily stole a sidelong glance at Caroline, sitting sullen and white-faced in the passenger seat. She refused to talk about her outburst in Singer&#x2019;s office, or to explain her reaction when the cottage became part of the conversation. Fine. Let her pout, or fume, or whatever <i>this</i> was. At the moment, Lily was too jet-lagged to launch into a proper cross-examination, but that didn&#x2019;t mean she wasn&#x2019;t going to get to the bottom of whatever was going on&#x2014;because something was definitely going on.</p><p>She swallowed a groan as she stepped into the elaborate foyer and kicked off her shoes. It was full of flowers, sickly sweet blooms that kept arriving every day as news of her father&#x2019;s death rippled through the world of international finance. Roses, lilies, gardenias&#x2014;their cloying scent mad...</p></p><h2>Sabine Lippert's Beadwork Evolution: New Techniques Using Peyote Stitch and Right Angle Weave (Lark Jewelry &amp; Beading Bead Inspirations)</h2><p>Sabine Lippert&#39;s unique, sophisticated jewelry designs have won her legions of fans worldwide.

By the author of The Oregon Trail.</p><p>Grade 5 Up-- Tracing the invention and development of the early railroad, Fisher blends fact, folklore, and the social and historical background necessary for understanding. The history is traced from the first locomotives through the race between the Tom Thumb and a horse-drawn wagon, to the story of John Henry, and on to the train's importance to the Civil War and westward expansion that culminated in the meeting of the transcontinental railroad in Promontory, Utah. Fisher goes beyond a merely factual accounting of the development of the rail system and includes its human impact in his narrative. The intrusion on the lands of Native Americans, the resulting wars, the careers of infamous robbers, and the train's effect on river transportation and the lives of the construction crews and railroad workers are all covered. Illustrative material is excellent, with a wide variety of photos and engravings of the people and equipment involved. Maps are sketchy, and one, showing only the Erie Canal's connection with Lake Ontario, and not the connection with Lake Erie at Buffalo, is inaccurate, but since few readers will look at a train book for information about canals, this omission can be overlooked. Overall, Tracks is a well-done, informative, and enjoyable work. --Jeffrey A. French, Cleveland Heights-University Heights Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Fisher expands handsomely on his The Railroads (1979), adding nearly 100 period photos, prints, and maps and describing in detail the industry's growth. He begins in England with the development of steam-driven pumps; in 1829, Horatio Allen displayed his Stourbridge Lion in the US and the race was on, impelled by westward expansion and the Industrial Revolution. Fisher devotes chapters to the use and abuse of railroads in the Civil War; the Cr&#x201a;dit Mobilier and other scandals; the just, but futile, Native American resistance; wrecks--the Camp Hill Disaster, the Angola Horror and, of course, Casey Jones's heroic end; robbers, tycoons, and workers (including the Harvey Girls); and the violent beginnings of organized labor. He closes with a brief discussion of technical innovations that made rail transport so fast and cheap by the century's end. Though the narrative is occasionally interrupted with lists of routes and companies that will interest only confirmed enthusiasts, the author clearly shows how and why railroads came to be pivotal in our history and society.

Weakened and embittered, trying and failing to come to terms with 600,000 dead and with an entire generation of men militarized by fighting, Italy gave birth to a new form of political life: Fascism. Richard Bosworth brings to life the period when Italians participated in a vast and ultimately ruinous political experiment under their dictator, Benito Mussolini, and his fascist henchmen. The fascists were the first totalitarians, aiming to reshape Italy and its people utterly. Their regime was based on a cult of violence and obedience. Yet, despite this, Italians found ingenious ways of adapting, limiting, undermining and ridiculing Mussolini&#39;s ambitions for them. The heart of this book is its engagement with the life of these ordinary Italians and their families, struggling through terrible times. Bosworth creates a powerful, plausible and entertaining picture of Italian life and a regime which - as the world hurtled towards the cataclysm of the Second World War - was to force humiliation, defeat, invasion and the utter collapse of the nation state.</p><p>Richard Bosworth is one of the world&#x2019;s leading writers on Fascist Italy whose life of Mussolini is the definitive account in English. He is Professor of History at the University of Western Australia.Shrewd, lucid, exhaustively documented and totally unsentimental. (David Schoenbaum, &#34;The New York Times&#34;) A powerful work of scholarship, beautifully written, which should be read by anyone interested in twentieth-century Europe. (&#34;The Economist&#34;) With this insightful, comprehensive study, Bosworth secures his place as one of the two leading historians in the English-speaking world . . . of twentieth-century Italy.

The match is part of a scheme: she is a witch, and is supposed to weaken her husband's power. Instead, they fall in love. Cursed after her father's death, she flees Scythia to be cleansed of her blood guilt. She journeys from Sparta, on the brink of its own doom, to Egypt, a dissolute empire where scarcely anything is truly sacred. Magic spells, tenderness, brutality, unnatural acts, primitive rites, beauty and love suffuse this intimate rendering of a heroic woman of the distant past. First published in 1931, this is Naomi Mitchison's masterwork.</p><p>A novel ahead of its time (1931) in many ways due to its quiet feminism and its insistence that women could have fun, and quest-plots, as well as men, this was acclaimed as one of the most important books of the year it was published.

Light years ahead of anything previously put into space, and built on technology developed for Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Star Wars,&#x201d; Iridium&#x2019;s constellation of 66 satellites in polar orbit meant that no matter where you were on Earth, at least one satellite was always overhead, and you could call Tibet from Fiji without a delay and without your call ever touching a wire.<br><br>Iridium the satellite system was a mind-boggling technical accomplishment, surely the future of communication. The only problem was that Iridium the company was a commercial disaster. Only months after launching service, it was $11 billion in debt, burning through $100 million a month and crippled by baroque rate plans and agreements that forced calls through Moscow, Beijing, Fucino, Italy, and elsewhere. Bankruptcy was inevitable&#x2014;the largest to that point in American history. And when no real buyers seemed to materialize, it looked like Iridium would go down as just a &#x201c;science experiment.&#x201d;<br><br>That is, until Dan Colussy got a wild idea. Colussy, a former head of Pan-Am now retired and working on his golf game in Palm Beach, heard about Motorola&#x2019;s plans to &#x201c;de-orbit&#x201d; the system and decided he would buy Iridium and somehow turn around one of the biggest blunders in the history of business.<br><br>In <i>Eccentric Orbits</i>, John Bloom masterfully traces the conception, development, and launching of Iridium and Colussy&#x2019;s tireless efforts to stop it from being destroyed, from meetings with his motley investor group, to the Clinton White House, to the Pentagon, to the hunt for customers in special ops, shipping, aviation, mining, search and rescue&#x2014;anyone who would need a durable phone at the end of the Earth. Impeccably researched and wonderfully told, <i>Eccentric Orbits</i> is a rollicking, unforgettable tale of technological achievement, business failure, the military-industrial complex, and one of the greatest deals of all time.</p><p><b>John Bloom</b> is a veteran investigative journalist, a three-time finalist for the National Magazine Award, and a Pulitzer Prize nominee.

It wasn't new-spilt, but it might look like it to someone who was unfamiliar with killing game in midwinter. Blood began darkening to black the moment it left the body, thickening and distilling until there was nothing but copper and iron left. It was different when the air crackled with ice. Blood could freeze in perfect red drops in the time it took to drip from an elk's collarbone to the taiga below. Raif remembered how he and Drey would scoop up frozen beads of elk blood after a kill and let them melt upon their tongues; sweet as fresh grass and salty as sweat. The taste of winter and clan.<br>But this wasn't elk's blood before them.<br>Raif glanced ahead to the top of the rise, where towers of white smoke rose straight in the still air. The trail had been rising all day and they still hadn't found the source of the smoke. The ground was hard and brittle here, formed from basalt and black chert. Cliffs soared to the east, high and straight as fortress walls, guarding knife-edged mountains beyond. To the west lay the farthest tip of the Storm Margin, its rocky draws and moraines disguised as rolling hills by a thick layer of snow. Beyond there lay the sea ice, and beyond that lay the sea. Stormheads gathering on the westernmost horizon had begun to silver the floes.<br>"What happened here?" asked Ash, who was standing above Raif as he crouched over the blood. Her voice was clear, but there was too much space between her words.<br>"One of the Sull breathed a vein."<br>"How can you be sure?"<br>Raif faked a shrug. "Even a clean kill leaves more blood." He fingered the red spots, remembering frozen carcasses, ice-bent blades, Tem Sevrance laughing at his sons as they strained to push an elk kill down a slope only to have it crash into the lake ice at the bottom and sink. When Raif continued speaking his voice was low. "And the blood wasn't sprayed. It dripped."<br>"How do you know it's human?"<br>Abruptly, Raif stood. He felt an irrational anger toward Ash and her questions. They both knew the answer here. Why did she force him to speak it?<br>"Listen," he said.<br>Standing side by side on the headland, their breath whitening in the freezing air, Raif Sevrance and Ash March listened to the sound they had been heading toward all day: a crackling hiss, as if lightning touched down upon water.<br>Raif counted the columns of smoke as he said, "They were here, Mal Naysayer and Ark Veinsplitter, they heard what we hear. They saw the smoke." And knew it was something to be feared, so they let blood to still their gods.<br>Ash nodded, as if she had heard what he had not spoken. "Should we make payment too?"<br>Raif shook his head and started forward. "This is not our land and not our business. There are no debts here for us to pay."<br>He hoped it was the truth.<br>They had been following the Sull warriors' trail for nine days. It had led them north and west from the Hollow River, across land Raif would never have dared to cross if it hadn't been for the telltale markings in the snow. Horse casts buried shallow, human hair snagged on the bark of a dead pine, a footprint stamped on new ice. The Sull had left "<i>Such a trail as can be followed by a clansman</i>." Raif's shoulders stiffened as he walked, aware of the insult in Ark Veinsplitter's words. "<i>We travel without leaving any trail</i>," they boasted, "<i>but will make effort to leave one for you</i>." Even as Raif had resented the Sull's arrogance, he knew to be thankful for their skills. No clansman would cross a green-froze lake, nor scale an unknown ice sheet in the hope of finding a pass.<br>The journey had not been easy. The days had been short and the nights long and full of silence. What could he and Ash say to each other? Raif wondered as he stripped bark for the watchfire each night. They could not talk about the Cavern of Black Ice, nor what had happened later, when they emerged from river and something, <i>something</i>, came with them. All Raif saw was a shadow, but shadows don't make pine needles crack beneath them...and shadows can't scream.<br>Raif shivered. Whatever it was, it was gone now. Fled. And even though they had seen nothing since, it had changed everything.<br>Ten days ago, in the cavern beneath the frozen river, he and Ash had spoken of returning to the clanholds, of finding Angus and journeying with him to Ille Glaive and visiting the Broken Man one last time. Heritas Cant had a promise to keep. "<i>Return safely from the Cavern of Black Ice and I will tell you the names of the beasts</i>," he had said. But now the word <i>safely</i> seemed an impossibly high standard to keep. They were not safe. Raif did not count himself a clansman anymore, but the old instincts had not left him. He knew when to fear. A deep unease had settled upon him, making him watchful and ready. The ice pick he counted as his only weapon lay cooling the skin at his waist.<br>He could not say whose decision it was to follow the Sull north. It was something else he and Ash didn't speak of, the need to learn more. The two Sull warriors knew what Ash was. She was a Reach, born to release the Endlords and their Taken from their thousand-year confinement in the Blind. Ark Veinsplitter and Mal Naysayer could provide proof that Ash had released her power safely, leaving the Blindwall intact, and the Endlords imprisoned in their own breed of hell. The Sull were the only ones who could tell them it was safe to return home.<br><i>Home</i>. Raif took a breath and held it. He could not return to his birthclan. Raif Sevrance had been judged an oathbreaker and traitor. There was no place for him at any hearth in the clanholds. He had no family or home...only Ash.<br>As he glanced toward her their gazes met. Eyes that had once been gray regarded him levelly. Before he and Ash had reached the Cavern of Black Ice her eyes had been the color of silver and hailstones. Now they were the color of the sky at midnight. A perfect Sull blue. If he thought about it too long he knew it would undo him. He and Ash had been through so much together. They had journeyed long and far, learned the many different ways to live with fear and weariness, and the only way to live with loss: simply to carry on. His arms knew what it felt like to bear her weight. She had leaned on him countless times, put her safekeeping willingly in his hands. Yet what she didn't know was that <i>his</i> safekeeping was in <i>her</i> hands. Ash March held the power to destroy him. All his dreams about the future centered around her. When everything was done and the nightmare that had become their lives had ended he hoped to take her somewhere new and begin again.<br>Digging his heels into the snow, Raif began the slow climb toward the ridge. Her eyes, that was the thing. Their blueness filled him with fear. Ash March had changed, and a small, insistent voice inside him warned that things could never be the same between them. A shift had taken place. Ash might be pale, and too thin for a girl of seventeen winters, yet strength lay in the set of her mouth and the determined tilt of her chin. Something new and vital had come alive within her, and Raif found himself waking in the darkest, coldest hours of each night, hoping that it wasn't something Sull.<br>It took them an hour to top the rise. Ash pushed ahead, and Raif was content to follow the shadow she cast against the full moon. Neither spoke as they surveyed the valley below. Twelve geysers of steam erupted from the ice and rubble of a dry glacier bed. A ring of blue fire blazed at the base of each column, leaping up from a crater of ash and melted stone that had formed around the burn. The roar was deafening: the crack of exploding rocks, the hiss of melting snow, and the constant <i>rip</i> of igniting gas.<br>The quickening wind brought the stench of char and lightning to Raif. He had no words for what he saw. To find fire and smoke here, at the frozen edge of the Storm Margin, seemed as impossible as finding breath in a corpse.<br>"Is this where the trail leads?" Ash asked, turning her face toward him.<br>He found he could not look into her eyes. "The trail cuts through the valley, toward the coast."<br>"So we must cross here?" As Ash spoke the ground moved beneath them, and rocks and snow spewed forth as a new column of smoke rent the valley floor<br><i>Thirteen</i>, Raif counted, feeling the heat of the explosion puff against his face. He remembered the tale of Murdo Blackhail, the Warrior Chief, who had led his men to war across the Stairlands. On the final day of their descent, the mountain had erupted above them, and a spray of molten rock burst forth. Murdo had been riding at the head of the party, high atop his stallion, Black Burr. His breastplate had burst into flame with the heat, and later when his armsman pulled it from him, Murdo's skin and muscle came with it. In the two days it took him to die, Murdo Blackhail directed his men to victory over Clan Thrall and took his wife to his bed, fathering their only son. Bessa, his wife, was led to her husband blindfold and with plugs of wax within each nostril, for the sight and stench of his burned flesh was said to be terrible to behold.<br>Raif grimaced. "We travel through the valley," he said.<br>The gas vents glowed blue in the failing light. Ash had little fear of them and picked a path through their center, once drawing close enough to a crater to drink water from its moat of melted snow. Raif spoke no word of warning, though he saw the danger clear enough. The entire valley floor was under pressure, its ancient rock buckled and twisted by whatever forces lay below. It might have been beautiful, this corridor of burning gas and rising smoke, but all the tales of hell he had listened to as a child had begun with an approach such as this.<br>They walked well into the night, Raif postponing making camp until the gas vents were far behind them. The next day the sun barely rose above the horizon, and what light it gave could hardly be called daylight at all. The following day was darker still, and the trail left by the Sull became more difficult to follow. As the afternoon wore on Raif began to spot signs of other men. Ice-bleached bones and sled tracks, dog fur and slicks of green whale oil pitted the path. The snow itself was hard and frozen, the air so dry and clear that even the finest specks of dust were revealed.<br>They came across the Whale Gate at some time during the long night. Formed from the jawbone of a massive bow whale, the ancient archway rose as high as two men and as wide as four. It stood alone on a headland of frost-cracked rocks and graying weeds, marking entrance into the territory beyond. Raif bit off his mitts and touched it with bare hands. The ivory was stained and scaling, its edges jagged with the stumps of baleen combs. Designs had been burned into the bone. Dolphins chasing stars had been seared atop an older, darker design of beasts slaying men.<br>Raif took his hands away. In the sheltered valley below the gate, the faintest possible lights twinkled, and above them a white haze of exhaled breaths shifted in the air like sleeping ghosts.<br>"The trail ends here." Raif couldn't remember the last time he had spoken, and his voice sounded strange and rough. He looked down upon the village, if village were what it was. Stone mounds, rising mere feet above the ground, formed a circle around a smoking firepit. The mounds were built of obsidian and basalt and other black things, and their edges glowed faintly in the starlight. They reminded Raif of the barrows of Dhoone's Core. Twelve thousand clansmen dead, each corpse interred in a stone tomb of its own. For three thousand years they'd lain there, rotting to bone dust and hollow teeth. Withy and Wellhouse kept no history of the massacre. Raif had once heard Inigar Stoop name it "the Price of Settlement," but warriors and chiefs gave it another name, whispered around campfires in the deep of night. The Field of Stone.<br>Suddenly Raif wanted very much to turn back, to grab Ash's hand and take her...<i>where</i>? No land that he knew of was safe.<br>Abruptly, Ash stepped through the gate, leaving Raif no choice but to follow her into the village below.<br>Dogs began barking as they approached. Yet even before the first growl of warning caused lights to brighten and stir, a figure stood in waiting at the first of the stone mounds. Raif recognized the pale bulk of Mal Naysayer, his cloak of wolverine fur stirring in the wind, the haft of his great two-handed longsword rising above his back. As Raif and Ash approached, the warrior stood unmoving, silent and terrible against a field of burning stars.<br>"<i>The Sull are not our people and they do not fear us</i>." The old clan words came to Raif as he raised a hand in greeting, yet they were old words and often said and men who knew nothing about the Sull spoke them, and they fell from his mind when the warrior began to kneel.<br>Mal Naysayer, Son of the Sull and chosen Far Rider, dropped to his knees as they drew near. He held his position until Ash and Raif passed within speaking distance and then laid himself down upon the snow.<br><i>Oh gods. So it begins</i>.<br>Muscles in the warrior's back moved beneath his cloak as he spread his arms wide to form a cross. Raif could see dozens of white letting scars on his knuckles as he dug bare fingers into ice. <i>Not for me</i>, Raif knew with certainty. <i>No Sull would prostrate himself before a clansman without a clan</i>.<br>Ash stood silent above the Sull, wrapped in lynx fur and boiled wool, her hair lifting and falling in the changing air. Nothing showed on her face, not exhaustion or fear...or surprise. "Rise, Mal Naysayer of the Sull, for we are old friends met in far lands and I would speak to your face, not your back."<br>Raif felt a tremor pass through him as she spoke. <i>How could I have come so far with her and not realize she has been leading the way all along</i>?<br>In silence, Mal Naysayer pulled himself to his feet. The silver chains and brain hooks at his waist chimed softly as he brushed snow from his mouth. Raif watched his eyes. Pale as ice and colder still, they spared no glance for the clansman. The warrior looked only at Ash.<br>"Snow burns," he said.<br>A chill went through Raif...and for one brief instant he almost knew why. He saw thirteen columns of smoke rising from a valley thick with snow, heard the old guide chanting a fragment of a cradle song, long forgot: <i>Snow burns, the Age turns, and Lost Men shall walk the earth</i>.<br>Ash breathed deeply and did not speak.<br>Raif spotted a line of men coming toward them, bearing spears pointed with volcanic glass and torches that burned with white-hot flames. Small and dark-skinned, they moved in the fluid and soundless manner of men accustomed to stalking large prey. Rib cages of walrus and seal were bound to their chests in armored plates, riding over layer upon layer of skins and strange furs. Forming a defensive half-circle behind the Naysayer, they thrust their spear butts deep into the snow.<br>Raif watched them watch him. He supposed he should be grateful that <i>they</i> at least considered him more of a threat than Ash, but the Sull's words had stirred a fear within him, and h...</p><h2>Mantra Meditation</h2><p>Karma: the consequence of all of your actions, decisions, thoughts, and emotions.

In <em>The Dog Department,</em> Michael J. Rosen, a literary dogcatcher of sorts, has gathered together Thurber's best in show. Here we have the stylish prose and drawings from <em>Thurber's Dogs</em> (which connected the words "Thurber" and "Dog" as inseparably as "Bartlett" and "Quotation," as "Emily Post" and "Etiquette"), along with unpublished material from the Thurber archives, a great sheaf of uncollected cartoons, and two dozen "Talk of the Town" miniatures from <em>The New Yorker</em> &#x2014; the consummate dog book from an artist of extraordinary pedigree. What other author can claim to have penned his own personal breed? The Thurber hound is a creature as unmistakable as Disney's mouse or Playboy's bunny.</p><p>In <em>The Dog Department</em> you'll find standard poodles, Scottish terriers, an Airedale, a rough collie, an American Staffordshire terrier &#x2014; all Thurber family members who inspired quintessential dog tales. For instance, there's Muggs, "the dog that bit people," an avocation that, each year, required Thurber's mother to send her famous chocolates to an ever-growing list of Muggs's victims. There's also a fair share about bloodhounds, German shepherd dogs, and pugs. But what you'll find remarkable and comforting is that reading Thurber from fifty or even seventy-five years ago is akin to reading about dogs today &#x2014; or about dogs from the previous century, as Thurber grew up reading &#x2014; or about dogs, we hope, from this new century we've just entered. <em>The Dog Department</em> is proof that Thurber's work defines the canine canon.</p></p><p><p>James Thurber was born in Columbus, Ohio, in 1894.

It is more than a summary of the trial and appellate record; it is also a gripping human drama about two people and the law. &#34;&#39;The Implosion Conspiracy&#39; does not address itself to the guilt or innocence of the Rosenbergs. Instead, a very legal question is raised: Was there sufficient evidence for the jury to find the Rosenbergs guilty. Nizer says yes. The hero in this book is not Julius or Ethel, but their attorney and justly so. Emanuel Bloch trial counsel for Julius and Ethel devoted himself completely to the cause of his clients. His was a devotion as personal as it was professional. When, despite his ceaseless efforts his clients died, part of him died as well. Six months later, harassed and exhausted, Bloch suffered a heart attack and died. As Nizer put it &#39;He died in the service of his clients.&#39; Emanuel Bloch did his profession proud.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Summertime: Fiction</h2><p>Shortlisted for the 2009 Man Booker Prize<br><br> <b> A brilliant new work of fiction from the Nobel Prize-winning author of <i>Disgrace</i> and <i>Diary of a Bad Year</i> </b><br><br> A young English biographer is researching a book about the late South African writer John Coetzee, focusing on Coetzee in his thirties, at a time when he was living in a rundown cottage in the Cape Town suburbs with his widowed father-a time, the biographer is convinced, when Coetzee was finding himself as a writer.

Carolia Maria de Jesus writes movingly of life in the Brazilian <i>favelas</i>, shantytown slums where she raised her children. And Alice Childress, a talented American writer and actress, contributes a hilarious one-sided conversation in which a brassed-off maid sets her employer straight regarding their decidedly nonfamilial relationship.

Against the sere blue winter sky, they seemed to be huge animals fleeing the newborn glare cast by Grandfather Day Maker&#x2019;s face.<br>Silver Sparrow glanced at them, and followed their lead, heading west. The cool air carried the scents of wet earth and frozen bark. He inhaled deeply as he tramped up the frosty trail through the forest.<br>Huge hickory trees towered above him, their bare limbs stark. Among the branches birds flitted and sang, creating a pleasant serenade. When he reached the top of the hill, he turned to look back at the black tracery of shadows painting the forest. The filigree wavered, rushing toward him when the wind blew, then flying away before he could reach out to touch it. His knees shook badly. He&#x2019;d seen fifty-three winters, and felt each one this morning. Long white hair swayed around his owlish face as he braced his feet to keep standing. Three days of fasting and praying had weakened his body, but his souls floated in euphoria, like bits of cattail down sailing on a warm autumn breeze. He started to turn back to the trail, but movement caught his eye. He squinted. Something blue flashed through the trees.<br>Sparrow stood quietly, waiting.<br>A man emerged. He wore a pack on his back, beneath his cape, and it made him look like a hunchback. Their people made a variety of winter garments: capes, heavy coats, short jackets. Each person had their own preferences.<br>&#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201c; Sparrow whispered to himself. &#x201c;Blessed ancestors, not today. Not when I so desperately need to be alone.&#x201d;<br>Tall Blue climbed the hill. His waist-length black hair gleamed with each step. The blue designs painted around the hem of his buckskin cape flashed as he walked through the streaks of sunlight. Twenty-seven winters old, he had a long straight nose and wide mouth. He also had a reputation for valor. No doubt the reason he&#x2019;d been chosen for this task.<br>&#x201c;I am seeking a vision!&#x201d; Sparrow shouted at the top of his lungs, startling the birds into silence. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what&#x2019;s happened, Blue!&#x201d;<br>Sparrow turned and forced his rubbery legs to carry him down the trail and across a meadow, hoping to outdistance the young man dogging his steps. Voles and mice leaped through the grass at the sound of his moccasins, scurrying for cover.<br>Sparrow shook his head in disgust. He hadn&#x2019;t the strength to engage in a lengthy conversation about anything. This had to be Dust Moon&#x2019;s doing. She was forever trying to sabotage his vision quests. The worst part was, as matron of Earth Thunderer Village, she had the right.<br>&#x201c;Elder?&#x201d; Tall Blue called in a deep apologetic voice. &#x201c;Wait. Please?&#x201d;<br>Sparrow pushed his legs harder, crunching over frozen leaves.<br>&#x201c;Go home, Blue!&#x201d;<br>Tall Blue spread his arms, as if helpless to comply.<br>Legs wobbling, Sparrow went to a fallen log and slumped down atop it, yelling, &#x201c;The Spirits are watching you, Tall Blue. Do you know this? They are watching and saying, &#x2018;Look at that young war leader annoying his elders. What shall we do with him?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>Tall Blue smiled. Sparrow had said similar words to him many times when Tall Blue had been a gangly growing boy.<br>&#x201c;I am not here of my own choice, Elder. You must know this.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. But for the sake of your great-grandmother&#x2019;s ghost, Blue, you also know I need to be alone! Why did you allow Dust Moon to bully you into coming?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Patron Buffalo Skull also asked me to speak with you, Elder.&#x201d;<br>A pinecone rested on the log a short distance away. Sparrow picked it up and threw it at the war leader. Tall Blue dodged the cone, gave Sparrow an indignant look, and continued walking.<br>He stopped ten paces in front of Sparrow. &#x201c;Forgive me, Elder. I really do carry important news from our clan leaders.&#x201d;<br>Sparrow folded his arms. &#x201c;But mostly from Dust Moon, correct? What happened? Did she discover a boil and wishes me to come and Dance over it?&#x201d;<br>Embarrassed by the lightness with which Sparrow took their clan matron&#x2019;s wishes, Tall Blue lowered his gaze and blinked at the ground. &#x201c;A passing Trader stopped and told us some terrible things.&#x201d;<br>Sparrow heaved a breath, but didn&#x2019;t answer. It was always something.<br>Tall Blue shifted his weight from one foot to the other. &#x201c;I know this is a distraction, Elder, but I must speak with you.&#x201d;<br>Sparrow&#x2019;s chest tightened. A distraction! Dust Moon must have told him that. Tall Blue would never think of something so ridiculous by himself. For the Earth Thunderer Clan, nothing was more important than seeking guidance from the Spirit World. Including impending warfare...which was surely why Tall Blue had come.<br>Sparrow closed his eyes, grumbled something unpleasant, then gestured to the log. &#x201c;Sit down, Blue. What is it?&#x201d;<br>Tall Blue sat down beside Sparrow, and his young face turned grim. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Walksalong Clan, Elder.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course it is. What&#x2019;s Jumping Badger done now?&#x201d;<br>For five winters, Jumping Badger, the war leader of Walksalong Village, had been terrorizing people for a moon&#x2019;s walk.<br>&#x201c;He attacked Sleeping Mist Village. At most that&#x2019;s--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Three days&#x2019; run from here.&#x201d; Sparrow knotted his fists and shook them at nothing. &#x201c;And Dust Moon is afraid we will be next. Yes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Elder.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what she expects me to do about it, Blue. Curse them and pray they turn on each other instead of us?&#x201d;<br>Earth Thunderer Clan was part of the Turtle Nation. Peaceful hunters and gatherers, the Turtle clans moved their small villages often, following the game, or visiting different root grounds or nut groves. Their distant relatives, the Bear Nation, saw this as a weakness. They&#x2019;d started openly attacking Turtle villages, pushing the people farther and farther away from the animals and plants they needed to survive, taking the land for themselves.<br>The Turtle clans had to fight back. Soon. And Sparrow had to give them his best advice. He couldn&#x2019;t do that until he&#x2019;d spoken to his Spirit Helper. This was not a matter for human beings. They had done all they could. Only the Spirits could resolve this problem.<br>Tall Blue&#x2019;s moccasins crunched the frozen snow at the base of the log. &#x201c;Elder?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You have been in the forest for three nights. Has your Spirit Helper appeared?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<em>No</em>!&#x201d;<br>The truth had been eating at him. Ordinarily his Helper came to him on the second day of questing. This was the beginning of the fourth day, and he hadn&#x2019;t even--<br>&#x201c;Matron Dust Moon said he probably hadn&#x2019;t,&#x201c; Tall Blue glibly informed him. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why she felt it would be all right to disturb your quest.&#x201d;<br>Idly, Sparrow wondered what would happen if he marched into Earth Thunderer Village and bashed Dust in the head with a war club.<br>&#x201c;So.&#x201d; Tall Blue slapped his palms on his knees. &#x201c;I have come to ask you to return to the village. Matron Dust Moon said that right after you&#x2019;ve given words in council you can return to your quest.&#x201d;<br>Sparrow just stared.<br>Dust had never undertaken a vision quest. She did not know the bitter cold that settled in the soul, or the effect that going without food or water for days had on the body. She could not even imagine the wrenching despair that consumed a Dreamer who feared he might fail.<br>Sparrow wet his chapped lips. They tasted of dried blood and salty tears. &#x201c;Do you have any notion what Matron Dust Moon would say if you&#x2019;d just brought her this message after she&#x2019;d been praying and fasting for days?&#x201d;<br>Tall Blue tilted his head. &#x201c;I--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;d tell you to go throw yourself off a cliff, which is what I ought to do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Elder,&#x201c; Tall Blue said in exasperation. &#x201c;The matron is not as horrible as you suppose.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me that.&#x201d; He narrowed his eyes. &#x201c;I lived with her for thirty-five winters, Blue. I <em>know</em>the twisted paths her thoughts take.&#x201d;<br>Wind Mother whistled above Sparrow, and a shower of snowflakes fell from the trees, glittering, onto his white hair and cape. He feebly brushed at them. &#x201c;You may tell my former wife that I will be home as soon as I&#x2019;ve finished my quest. Not before.&#x201d;<br>Tall Blue nodded dejectedly. &#x201c;I will, of course, do as you say, Elder. I just hope she doesn&#x2019;t come looking for you herself.&#x201d;<br>Blue shrugged out of his pack and pulled it onto the log between them. As he loosened the laces and began to dig around inside, the sweet scent of roasted corn rose. &#x201c;Forgive me, Elder. I&#x2019;ll leave as soon as I&#x2019;ve eaten. I&#x2019;ve been searching for you since early yesterday.&#x201d;<br>Sparrow&#x2019;s belly groaned at the sweet aroma of corn cakes filled with roasted hickory nuts. It occurred to him that the scent was achingly familiar. He lifted a brow. &#x201c;Dust Moon made those for you, didn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why, yes, Elder,&#x201c; Tall Blue said around a bite. &#x201c;How did you know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because they&#x2019;re my favorites, that&#x2019;s why.&#x201d; Through gritted teeth, Sparrow said, &#x201c;I swear she&#x2019;s the spawn of witches.&#x201d;<br>Tall Blue finished his first cake, and started on a second. Crumbs fell down the front of his cape.<br>Sparrow should have known Dust would do something like this.<br>Only five nights before she had arrived at his house, and announced that she&#x2019;d just spoken to a runner who&#x2019;d told her he&#x2019;d seen Bear Nation warriors massing--as if...</p></p><h2>Lost in the Yellowstone: Truman Everts&#39;s &#34;Thirty-Seven Days of Peril&#34;</h2><p><p>Western History</p><p>The incredible true adventure of the only person known to have survived so long while lost in Yellowstone wilderness.<br><br>When Truman Evert visited the Yellowstone area in 1870, the Yellowstone belonged to myth. Scattered reports of a mostly unexplored wilderness filled with natural wonders caught the public&#x2019;s&#x2014;and Evert&#x2019;s&#x2014;attention. Although fifty-four, nearsighted, and an inexperienced woodsman, he joined the expedition determined to map and investigate the mysterious Yellowstone.<br><br>Separated from his party, and then abandoned by his horse, Evert embarked on one of the most grueling survival adventures recorded on the American frontier. For thirty-seven days he wandered Yellowstone alone, injured, and without food save that which he could scrape from an unfriendly land.<br><br>Truman Evert&#x2019;s story manifests the qualities we associate with the great explorers: endurance, determination, inventiveness, and courage in the face of unendurable hardship. <i>Lost in the Yellowstone</i> is an inspiration, and a testament to one man&#x2019;s will to survive.</p></p><p><p><b>Lee Whittlesey</b> is Park Historical Archivist and acting historian for Yellowstone National Park.</p></p><h2>Basic Yoga for Everybody: Kit: 84 Cards With Accompanying Handbook</h2><p>No more trying to turn the pages of a book while standing on your head!

Reissue.</p><p><p>Roger Zelazny&nbsp;burst onto the SF scene in the early 1960s with a series of dazzling and groundbreaking short stories. He won his first of six Hugo Awards for&nbsp;<em>Lord of Light</em>, and soon after produced the first book of his enormously popular&nbsp;<em>Amber</em>&nbsp;series,&nbsp;<em>Nine Princes in Amber.</em>&nbsp;In addition to his Hugos, he went on to win three Nebula Awards over the course of a long and distinguished career. He died on June 14, 1995.</p>Some fans of Zelazny's dense, brilliant writings from the '60s have been dismayed at the time and effort he has invested in his Amber series during the past 16 years. If these fantasy adventures are simple and formulaic compared with his best work, they have earned him a whole new audience by virtue of their elegance, humor, literacy, vivid action and lightly applied but complex background of tarot, alternate worlds, Olympian gods, and a magic so neat and clear that computers can learn it. In this seventh installment, the sorcerer Merlin of Amberaka Merle Corey of San Franciscolearns the identities of two would-be assassins but makes a truce with one to pursue the greater, more dangerous power beyond them. Once again, the limited plot is enlivened by Zelazny's irony, his bravura sequences (particularly a harbor visit that turns nasty in Death Alley) and his laconic sense of the incongruous (are magicians the ultimate surrealist artists?).

Nothing has turned yet into longing, into bitterness, into the cold that will never cease, not even in the heat of summer.</i></p><p><i>The wind, at first, is pleasant, too&#x2014;softly whistling past you, so that you almost don&#x2019;t notice when its cold fingers tear at your wings. Feathers drift off, blinking like forgotten jewels, catching fire and burning like a thousand falling stars in the atmosphere. Some part of you knows you should be experiencing pain; that the flow of crimson blood, the lancing pain in your back, the fiery sensation that seems to have hold of your whole body&#x2014;they&#x2019;re all yours, they&#x2019;re all irreversible and deadly. But you feel nothing: no exhilaration, no relief, not the searing agony of your wounds. Nothing but that sense of unnamed relief, that knowledge you won&#x2019;t have to face the judges in the City again.</i></p><p><i>Nothing, until the ground comes up to meet you, and you land in a jumble of pain and shattered bones; and the scream you didn&#x2019;t think you had in you scrapes your throat raw as you let it out&#x2014;like the first, shocked breath of a baby newly born into a universe of suffering.</i></p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>IT was Ninon who first saw her. Philippe had felt her presence first, but hadn&#x2019;t said anything. It wasn&#x2019;t a wish to protect the young Fallen so much as to protect himself&#x2014;his status in the Red Mamba Gang was precarious as it was, and he had no desire to remind them how great a commodity he could become, given enough cruelty on their part. And Heaven knew, of course, that those days it didn&#x2019;t take much for cruelty or despair to get the better of them all, when life hung on a razor&#x2019;s edge, even for a former Immortal.</p><p>They&#x2019;d been scavenging in the Grands Magasins&#x2014;desperate and hungry, as Ninon had put it, because no one was foolish enough to go down there among the ruins of the Great Houses War, with spells that no one had had time to clean up primed and ready to explode in your face, with the ghosts and the hauntings and the odor of death that still hung like fog over the wrecks of counters and the faded posters for garments and perfumes from another, more innocent age.</p><p>No one, that is, but the gangs: the losers in the great hierarchy, the bottom-feeders surviving on the carrion the Houses left them. Gangs could be huge, could number dozens of people, but they were fractured and powerless, deprived of the magic that made the Houses the true movers of Paris. And as far as gangs went, the Red Mambas were small; twenty or so members under Bloody Jeanne&#x2019;s leadership; and Philippe, on the bottom tier of the bottom tiers, just doing his best to survive&#x2014;as always.</p><p>He and Ninon had been under the dome of the Galeries Lafayette, crossing over the rubble in the center&#x2014;what had once been the accessories department. On the walls were fragments of advertisement posters, colored scraps; bits and pieces of idealized human beings, of products that had long since ceased to be manufactured; and a fragment promising that the 1914 fashion season would be the headiest the city had ever seen: a season that, of course, had never been, swallowed up by the beginning of the war. Ahead were the stairs, blocked by debris; the faces of broken mannequins stared back at them, uncannily pale and expressionless, their eyes shining like cats&#x2019; in the dim light.</p><p>Philippe hated the Grands Magasins&#x2014;not that he was as superstitious as Ninon, but he could <i>feel</i> the pall of death hanging over the place, could almost hear the screams of the dying when the petrification spells had struck. Like any Immortal&#x2014;even a diminished one, far from his home and his people&#x2014;he could feel the <i>khi</i> currents, could sense their broken edges rubbing against him, as sharp as serrated knives.</p><p>&#x201c;Ninon&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Ahead, on the stairs, she&#x2019;d turned back at him, her face flushed with the excitement of it all, that incomprehensible desire to flirt with danger until it killed you. A wholly human thing, of course; and he was meant to be human again, now that he had been cast out of the Heavens; but even as a mortal in Annam he&#x2019;d just never had that kind of reckless death wish. &#x201c;We should go&#x2014;&#x201d; he&#x2019;d started, and then he&#x2019;d felt it.</p><p>It was pure and incandescent, a wave of stillness that seemed to start somewhere in his belly and spread to his entire body&#x2014;a split second when wind ran on his arms and face, and darkness stole across his field of vision, as if night had unexpectedly fallen in the world beyond the dome; and a raw sense of pain rose in him, a scream building in his lungs, on the verge of forcing its way out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>And then it was gone, leaving him wrung out, panting on the staircase as if he&#x2019;d just run for his life across Paris. The pain was still at the back of his mind&#x2014;a faint, watered-down memory that he would recognize anywhere&#x2014;just as he would unerringly be able to find its source.</p><p>A Fallen. A young one, barely manifested in the world, lying in pain, somewhere close; somewhere <i>vulnerable</i> in a city where young Fallen were merchandise, creatures to be taken apart and killed before they became too powerful and did the taking apart and the killing.</p><p>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Ninon asked. She was watching him, eyes narrowed. &#x201c;Not going to go all mystical on me, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>Philippe shook his head, struggling for breath&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t show weakness, couldn&#x2019;t show ignorance, not if he wanted to survive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At last he managed, in something like his usual flippant tones, &#x201c;No way, sis. This is about the worst place in the world to get an attack of the mystical.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t mean you idiots wouldn&#x2019;t get one,&#x201d; Ninon said, darkly. &#x201c;Come on. Alex said there was good booty on the third floor, perfumes and alchemical reserves.&#x201d;</p><p>The last thing Philippe wanted to do was go upstairs, or hang around the place any longer than he had to. &#x201c;And they&#x2019;ve remained miraculously untouched for sixty years? Either Alex is misinformed or there&#x2019;s some pretty heavy defenses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Ninon grinned with the abandon of youth. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we have you, don&#x2019;t we? To make short work of anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Philippe said. He could cast some spells; call on some small remnants of who he had been, drawing from the <i>khi</i> fields around him. He would, however, have to be seriously insane to do it here. But he daren&#x2019;t protest too much, or too loudly; he was, as Ninon had reminded him, only useful as long as he could provide magic&#x2014;the conscious, mastered kind, one cut above the lures of angel essence and other adjuncts. When that ceased&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>He forced himself not to think about it as he followed her upstairs&#x2014;past landing after deserted landing, under the vacant eyes of models in burned posters, past the tarnished mirrors and the shards of chandeliers. As he had feared, the pain at the back of his mind grew steadily, a sign they were approaching the Fallen&#x2019;s birth site. Ninon herself wasn&#x2019;t a witch&#x2014;the magical practitioners had long since been snapped up by the Houses&#x2014;but for all that, she was uncannily, unerringly headed toward the newly manifested Fallen. &#x201c;Ninon&#x2014;&#x201d; he said, as they rounded a ruined display promising exotic scents from Annam and the Far East, a memory of a home that was no longer his.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>She&#x2019;d stopped, one hand going to her mouth. He couldn&#x2019;t tell what her expression was, from behind, if it was horror or fascination or something else. As Philippe got closer, he saw what she saw: a jumble of crimson-stained feathers, a tangled mass that seemed to be all broken limbs and bleeding wounds; and, over it all, a gentle sloshing radiance like sunlight seen through water, a light that promised the soft warmth of live coals, the comfort of wintertime meals heated on the stove, the sheer relief just after the breaking of a thunderstorm, when the air was cleansed of all heaviness.</p><p>Philippe recovered faster than Ninon. While she still stood, gaping at the vision, he cautiously approached, circling the body with care, just in case the Fallen turned out vicious. But Philippe didn&#x2019;t think it would.</p><p>Close up, the body was a mess: bones broken in several places, not always cleanly; the hands splayed out in abandon, loosely resting above dislocated wrists; the torso covered with blood and unidentifiable fluids. There was no smell, though; no stench of blood or ruptured guts; just a tang to the air, an acridity like a remnant of burning wood. Young Fallen never smelled like much of anything, not until the light vanished. Not until they joined the mortal plane like the rest of their kind.</p><p>The face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the face was intact, and that was almost the most gruesome thing about the Fallen. Eyes frozen in shock stared at him. The gaze was somehow ageless, that of a being that had endured beyond time, in a City that had nothing human or fragile about it. The cheekbones were high, and something in the cast of the face was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. familiar, somehow. Philippe glanced back at the mess of the torso, noting the geometry of the chest: this particular Fallen manifested as female.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t expected to be so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. detached about things. He&#x2019;d thought of a thousand ways she could have reminded him of the Great War, of the bloodied bodies by his side; but in some indefinable way she seemed beyond it all, a splayed doll rather than a broken body&#x2014;he shouldn&#x2019;t think that, he really shouldn&#x2019;t, but it was all too easy to remember that it was her kind that had torn him from his home in Annam and sent him to slaughter, that had gloried in each of the dead, that had laughed to see his unit come back short so many soldiers, covered in the blood of their comrades&#x2014;her kind, that ruled over the ruins of the city.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Awesome,&#x201d; Ninon said. She knelt, her hands and arms bathed in the radiance, breathing in the light, the magic that hung coiled in the air around them. Fallen were magic: raw power descended to Earth, the younger the more powerful. &#x201c;Come on, help me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Help&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;</p><p>Ninon&#x2019;s hand flicked up; it came up with a serrated knife, the wickedly sharp blade catching the light.</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t carry her. Too much work, and there&#x2019;s only two of us. But we can take stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>Stuff. Flesh and bone and blood, all that carried the essence of a Fallen, all that could be inhaled, put into artifacts, used to pass on magic and the ability to cast spells to others. He put his hand in the blood, lifted it to his mouth. The air seemed to tremble around his fingers as if in a heat wave, and the blood down his throat was as sweet as honey, warming his entire body, reminding him how it had been when he&#x2019;d been an Immortal; and a flick of his hands could have transported him from end to end of Indochina, turned peach trees into magical swords, turned bullets aside as easily as wisps of vapor.</p><p>But that time was past. Had been past for more than sixty years, turned to dust as surely and as enduringly as his mortal family.</p><p>Ninon&#x2019;s face was bathed in radiance as she knelt by the body&#x2014;she was going for a hand or a limb, something that would have power, that would be worth something, enough to sustain them all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&#x2014; The thought of her sawing through flesh and bone and sinew shouldn&#x2019;t have made him sick, but it was one thing to hate Fallen, quite another to cold-bloodedly do <i>this</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;We could take the blood,&#x201d; he said, forcing his voice to come back from the distant past. &#x201c;Use the old perfume bottles to mix our own elixirs.&#x201d;</p><p>Ninon didn&#x2019;t look up, but he heard her snort. &#x201c;Blood&#x2019;s piffle,&#x201d; she said, lifting a limp, torn hand and eyeing it speculatively. &#x201c;You know it&#x2019;s not where the money is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter? You feeling some kind of loyalty for your own kind?&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t need to make the threat, didn&#x2019;t need to point out he was as good a source of magic as the Fallen by her side.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, help me,&#x201d; she said; and as she lifted the knife, her eyes aglow with greed, Philippe gave in and pulled his own from his jacket; and braced himself for the inevitable grinding of metal against bone, and for the Fallen&#x2019;s pain to paralyze his mind.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>SELENE was coming home to Silverspires when she felt it. It was faint at first, a chord struck somewhere in the vastness of the city, but then she tasted pain like a sharp tang against her palate.</p><p>She raised a hand, surprised to find she&#x2019;d bitten her tongue; probed at a tooth, trying to see if the feeling would vanish. But it didn&#x2019;t; rather, it grew in intensity, became a tingling in the soles of her feet, in her fingertips&#x2014;a burning in her belly, a faint echo of what must have been unbearable.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>There were four of them in the car that night: two of her usual guards, Luc and Imadan, and Javier, the Jesuit, the latest of several incongruous additions to the House. He had volunteered when Selene&#x2019;s chauffeur fell ill. She&#x2019;d found him in the great hall, stubbornly waiting for her, his olive skin standing out against the darkness of his clothes; and had simply gestured him into the car. They&#x2019;d hardly spoken a word since, and Selene hadn&#x2019;t probed. Like the rest of the motley band that constituted the House, Javier would open in his own time; there was little sense in trying to nudge or break him open&#x2014;God knew Selene had had enough experience, by now, of what it meant to break people. Morningstar had taught her well, from beginning to end.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Javier asked.</p><p>Selene raised a hand to silence him, seeking the origin of the magic. Young, and desperate; she&#x2019;d almost forgotten how that tasted, how bittersweet it all was, that mixture of bewilderment and pain that came just after the Fall.</p><p>West, in the ruined blocks that had been the great department stores and the great hotels before the war, their names like a litany of what had been lost: the Printemps, the Galeries Lafayette, the H�tel Scribe, the Grand H�tel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. West, where the House of Lazarus still stood. And if she could feel it, so could every other Fallen in the vicinity; and perhaps their pet mages, too, if they had the right artifacts or were pumped up on essence.</p><p>Needless to say, Selene did not approve of essence.</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have much time,&#x201d; she said to Javier. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an infant Fallen, and it&#x2019;s in trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>Javier&#x2019;s face was pale, but set. &#x201c;Tell me where.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Selene said. &#x201c;Left at the next intersection.&#x201d;</p><p>The car moved smoothly under Javier&#x2019;s hands&#x2014;though of course there was nothing smooth about it, and the battered and old metal carcass ran as much on magic as it did on expensive fuel.</p><p>Left, straight ahead, right, left. It was in her bones now, a dull vibration, a vague hint of something red-hot and searing, something that would overwhelm her, given half a chance.</p><p>Ahead was the dark mass of the Galeries Lafayette: the dome had miraculously survived the war and everything thrown at it, but the insouciant crowds that had once filled the shops at the beginning of the t...</p></p><h2>In the Hall of the Dragon King (The Dragon King Trilogy, Book 1)</h2><p>An innocent acolyte sets out to rescue King Eskevar, who was imprisoned by a craven usurper and a powerful necromancer who have joined in an unholy union to devour a realm.

This publication shows not only how &#34;the bricks&#34; are indeed sculpture, but that minimalist works such as this present some of the most interesting and imaginative work of the 1960s. Minimalism emerged and developed as a reaction against the emotiveness of abstract expressionism. Although most of the artists involved did not regard themselves as part of a group, there are certain key factors which define minimalist work: it is abstract, three-dimensional, modular, serial, geometric, preconceived in design and industrial in execution. This introduction examines the implications of these characteristics, looking in particular at the work of key artists: Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd and Sol LeWitt. It also focuses on the different emphases in each artist&#39;s work. The book also looks at the varied types of criticism and interpretation to which minimalism has been subject over the years. It ends by discussing how minimalism, which has influenced almost every subsequent art movement, has continuing relevance for artists today.</p><p>Minimalism emerged and developed as a reaction against the emotiveness of Abstract Expressionism.

A founding member of the Viennese Secession and a leader of the Art Nouveau movement, Klimt was an innovator who achieved success with large decorative schemes as well as smaller portraits and paintings. He is admired for his sensuous images of women and for his original vision, producing images such as &#34;Love&#34;, &#34;The Three Ages of Man&#34; and &#34;The Kiss&#34;.</p><p>A Taschen look at Gustav Klimt, man and artist.Gilles N�ret (1933-2005) was an art historian, journalist, writer and museum correspondent.

Pike currently lives in Santa Barbara, where it is rumored he never leaves his house. But he can be found online at ChristopherPikeBooks.com.The heavy metal aesthetic teams up with wishy-washy New Age mysticism in this reworking of the film It's a Wonderful Life. When Teresa discovers that her boyfriend Bill has dumped her in favor of her best friend, she jumps into her car and takes off into the night. On the road, the girl picks up two strange hitchhikers: the sexy magician Freedom Jack and his dour, chain-smoking companion, Poppy Corn. En route to the Bardos Club, their ultimate destination, Jack and Poppy take turns telling the tale of two star-crossed lovers while Teresa chronicles her failed romance. After a stop-over with the psychic crone Jack calls his mother, Teresa begins to suspect that her unplanned trip has led her into realms not charted on any map. With its lugubrious writing ("His wife had recently left him for a filmmaker of animal documentaries") and predictable storyline--not to mention some achingly bad song lyrics in its first section--this novel is not exactly vintage Pike. Still, the author's loyal fans may well appreciate this particular variety of watered-down spirituality. Also, the novel's life-affirming finale makes for a nice change in a genre that is often relentlessly gory.

Spoons.<br> <br>In that order.<br> <br>Britt-Marie is certainly not the kind of person who judges other people. Far from it.<br> <br>But surely no civilized person would even think of arranging a cutlery drawer in a different way from how cutlery drawers are supposed to be arranged?<br> <br>We&#x2019;re not animals, are we?<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a Monday in January. She&#x2019;s sitting at a desk in the unemployment office. Admittedly there&#x2019;s no cutlery in sight, but it&#x2019;s on her mind because it sums up everything that&#x2019;s gone wrong recently. Cutlery should be arranged as it always has been, because life should go on unchanged. Normal life is presentable. In normal life you clean up the kitchen and keep your balcony tidy and take care of your children. It&#x2019;s hard work&#x2014;harder than one might think. In normal life you certainly don&#x2019;t find yourself sitting in the unemployment office.<br> <br>The girl who works here has staggeringly short hair, Britt-Marie thinks, like a man&#x2019;s. Not that there&#x2019;s anything wrong with that, of course&#x2014;it&#x2019;s modern, no doubt. The girl points at a piece of paper and smiles, evidently in a hurry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just fill in your name, social security number, and address here, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie has to be registered. As if she were a criminal. As if she has come to steal a job rather than find one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Milk and sugar?&#x201d; the girl asks, pouring some coffee into a plastic mug.<br> <br>Britt-Marie doesn&#x2019;t judge anyone. Far from it. But who would behave like that? A plastic mug! Are we at war? She&#x2019;d like to say just that to the girl, but because Kent is always urging Britt-Marie to &#x201c;be more socially aware&#x201d; she just smiles as diplomatically as she can and waits to be offered a coaster.<br> <br>Kent is Britt-Marie&#x2019;s husband. He&#x2019;s an entrepreneur. Incredibly, incredibly successful. Has business dealings with Germany and is extremely, extremely socially aware.<br> <br>The girl offers her two tiny disposable cartons of the sort of milk that doesn&#x2019;t have to be kept in the fridge. Then she holds out a plastic mug with plastic teaspoons protruding from it. Britt-Marie could not have looked more startled if she&#x2019;d been offered roadkill.<br> <br>She shakes her head and brushes her hand over the table as if it was covered in invisible crumbs. There are papers everywhere, in any old order. The girl clearly doesn&#x2019;t have time to tidy them up, Britt-Marie realizes&#x2014;she&#x2019;s probably far too busy with her career.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; says the girl pleasantly, turning back to the form, &#x201c;just write your address here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie fixes her gaze on her lap. She misses being at home with her cutlery drawer. She misses Kent, because Kent is the one who fills in all the forms.<br> <br>When the girl looks like she&#x2019;s about to open her mouth again, Britt-Marie interrupts her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You forgot to give me a coaster,&#x201d; says Britt-Marie, smiling, with all the social awareness she can muster. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to make marks on your table. Could I trouble you to give me something to put my . . . coffee cup on?&#x201d;<br> <br>She uses that distinctive tone, which Britt-Marie relies on whenever she has to summon all her inner goodness, to refer to it as a &#x201c;cup&#x201d; even though it is a plastic mug.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry, just put it anywhere.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if life was as simple as that. As if using a coaster or organizing the cutlery drawer in the right order didn&#x2019;t matter. The girl&#x2014;who clearly doesn&#x2019;t appreciate the value of coasters, or proper cups, or even mirrors, judging by her hairstyle&#x2014;taps her pen against the paper, by the &#x201c;address&#x201d; box.<br> <br>&#x201c;But surely we can&#x2019;t just put our cups on the table? That leaves marks on a table, surely you see that.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl glances at the surface of the desk, which looks as if toddlers have been trying to eat potatoes off it. With pitchforks. In the dark.<br> <br>&#x201c;It really doesn&#x2019;t matter; it&#x2019;s so old and scratched up already!&#x201d; she says with a smile.<br> <br>Britt-Marie is screaming inside.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you&#x2019;ve considered that it&#x2019;s because you don&#x2019;t use coasters,&#x201d; she mutters, not at all in a &#x201c;passive-aggressive&#x201d; way, which is how Kent&#x2019;s children once described her when they thought she wasn&#x2019;t listening. Britt-Marie is not actually passive-aggressive. She&#x2019;s considerate. After she heard Kent&#x2019;s children saying she was passive-aggressive she was extra considerate for several weeks.<br> <br>The unemployment office girl looks a little strained. &#x201c;Okay . . . what did you say your name was? Britt, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Britt-Marie. Only my sister calls me Britt.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Britt-Marie, if you could just fill in the form. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie peers at the paper, which requires her to give assurances about where she lives and who she is. An unreasonable amount of paperwork is required these days just to be a human being. A preposterous amount of administration for society to let one take part. In the end she reluctantly fills in her name, social security number, and her cell phone number. The address box is left empty.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your educational background, Britt-Marie?&#x201d;<br> <br>Britt-Marie squeezes her handbag.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have you know that my education is excellent.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But no formal education?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For your information, I solve an enormous number of crosswords. Which is not the sort of thing one can do without an education.&#x201d;<br> <br>She takes a very small gulp of the coffee. It doesn&#x2019;t taste like Kent&#x2019;s coffee at all. Kent makes very good coffee. Everyone says so. Britt-Marie takes care of the coasters and Kent takes care of the coffee.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay . . . what sort of life experience do you have?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My latest employment was as a waitress. I had outstanding references.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl looks hopeful. &#x201c;And when was that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nineteen seventy-eight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah . . . and you haven&#x2019;t worked since then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have worked every day since then. I&#x2019;ve helped my husband with his company.&#x201d;<br> <br>Again the girl looks hopeful. &#x201c;And what sorts of tasks did you perform in the company?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I took care of the children and saw to it that our home was presentable.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl smiles to hide her disappointment, as people do when they don&#x2019;t have the ability to distinguish between &#x201c;a place to live&#x201d; and &#x201c;a home.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s actually thoughtfulness that makes the difference. Because of thoughtfulness there are coasters and proper coffee cups and beds that are made so tightly in the mornings that Kent jokes with his acquaintances about how, if you stumble on the threshold on your way into the bedroom, there&#x2019;s &#x201c;a smaller risk of breaking your leg if you land on the floor than the bedspread.&#x201d; Britt-Marie loathes it when he talks that way. Surely civilized people lift their feet when they walk across bedroom thresholds?<br> <br>Whenever Britt-Marie and Kent go away, Britt-Marie sprinkles the mattress with baking soda for twenty minutes before she makes the bed. The baking soda absorbs dirt and humidity, leaving the mattress much fresher. Baking soda helps almost everything, in Britt-Marie&#x2019;s experience. Kent usually complains about being late; Britt-Marie clasps her hands together over her stomach and says: &#x201c;I absolutely must be allowed to make the bed before we leave, Kent. Just imagine if we die!&#x201d;<br> <br>This is the actual reason why Britt-Marie hates traveling. Death. Not even baking soda has any effect on death. Kent says she exaggerates, but people do actually drop dead all the time when they&#x2019;re away, and what would the landlord think if they had to break down the door only to find an unclean mattress? Surely they&#x2019;d conclude that Kent and Britt-Marie lived in their own dirt?<br> <br>The girl checks her watch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>Britt-Marie feels her tone has a note of criticism in it.<br> <br>&#x201c;The children are twins and we have a balcony. It&#x2019;s more work than you think, having a balcony.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl nods tentatively.<br> <br>&#x201c;How old are your children?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kent&#x2019;s children. They&#x2019;re thirty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So they&#x2019;ve left home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Obviously.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re sixty-three years old?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; says Britt-Marie dismissively, as if this was highly irrelevant.<br> <br>The girl clears her throat as if, actually, it&#x2019;s very relevant indeed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Britt-Marie, quite honestly, because of the financial crisis and all that, I mean, there&#x2019;s a scarcity of jobs for people in your . . . situation.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl sounds a bit as if &#x201c;situation&#x201d; was not her first choice as a way of concluding the sentence. Britt-Marie smiles patiently.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kent says that the financial crisis is over. He&#x2019;s an entrepreneur, you must understand. So he understands these kind of things, which are possibly a little outside your field of competence.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl blinks for an unnecessary amount of time. Checks her watch. She seems uncomfortable, which vexes Britt-Marie. She quickly decides to give the girl a compliment, just to show her goodwill. She looks around the room for something to compliment her about, and finally manages to say, with as generous a smile as she can muster:<br> <br>&#x201c;You have a very modern hairstyle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? Oh. Thanks,&#x201d; she replies, her fingertips moving self-consciously towards her scalp.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very courageous of you to wear your hair so short when you have such a large forehead.&#x201d;<br> <br>Why does the girl look offended? Britt-Marie wonders. Clearly that&#x2019;s what happens when you try to be sociable towards young people these days. The girl rises from her chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for coming, Britt-Marie. You are registered in our database. We&#x2019;ll be in touch!&#x201d;<br> <br>She holds out her hand to say good-bye. Britt-Marie stands up and places the plastic mug of coffee in her hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s difficult to say.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose I&#x2019;m supposed to just sit and wait,&#x201d; counters Britt-Marie with a diplomatic smile, &#x201c;as if I didn&#x2019;t have anything better to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl swallows.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, my colleague will be in touch with you about a jobseekers&#x2019; training course, an&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want a course.

She has so many lists that she has to keep a separate list to list all the lists. Otherwise anything could happen. She could die. Or forget to buy baking soda.<br> <br>The girl offers her a pen and says something to the effect of, &#x201c;Actually I don&#x2019;t have time tomorrow,&#x201d; but Britt-Marie is too busy peering at the pen to hear what she&#x2019;s saying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Surely we can&#x2019;t write lists in ink?&#x201d; she bursts out.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d; The girl says this with some finality. &#x201c;Is there anything else I can help you with today, Britt-Marie?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; Britt-Marie responds after a moment.<br> <br>Britt-Marie often says that. &#x201c;Ha.&#x201d; Not as in &#x201c;ha-ha&#x201d; but as in &#x201c;aha,&#x201d; spoken in a particularly disappointed tone. Like when you find a wet towel thrown on the bathroom floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha.&#x201d; Immediately after saying this, Britt-Marie always firmly closes her mouth, to emphasize this is the last thing she intends to say on the subject. Although it rarely is the last thing.<br> <br>The girl hesitates. Britt-Marie grasps the pen as if it&#x2019;s sticky. Looks at the list marked &#x201c;Tuesday&#x201d; in her notebook, and, at the top, above &#x201c;Cleaning&#x201d; and &#x201c;Shopping,&#x201d; she writes &#x201c;Unemployment office to contact me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She hands back the pen.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was very nice to meet you,&#x201d; says the girl robotically. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be in touch!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; says Britt-Marie with a nod.<br> <br>Britt-Marie leaves the unemployment office. The girl is obviously under the impression that this is the last time they&#x2019;ll meet, because she&#x2019;s unaware of how scrupulously Britt-Marie sticks to her lists. Clearly the girl has never seen Britt-Marie&#x2019;s balcony.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s an astonishingly, astonishingly presentable balcony.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s January outside, a winter chill in the air but no snow on the ground&#x2014;below freezing without any evidence of it being so. The very worst time of year for balcony plants.<br> <br>After leaving the unemployment office, Britt-Marie goes to a supermarket that is not her usual supermarket, where she buys everything on her list. She doesn&#x2019;t like shopping on her own, because she doesn&#x2019;t like pushing the shopping cart. Kent always pushes the shopping cart while Britt-Marie walks at his side and holds on to a corner of it. Not because she&#x2019;s trying to steer, only that she likes holding on to things while he is also holding on to them. For the sake of that feeling they are going somewhere at the same time.<br> <br>She eats her dinner cold at exactly six o&#x2019;clock. She&#x2019;s used to sitting up all night waiting for Kent, so she tries to put his portion in the fridge. But the only fridge here is full of very small bottles of alcohol. She lowers herself onto a bed that isn&#x2019;t hers, while rubbing her ring finger, a habit she falls into when she&#x2019;s nervous.<br> <br>A few days ago she was sitting on her own bed, spinning her wedding ring, after cleaning the mattress extra carefully with baking soda. Now she&#x2019;s rubbing the white mark on her skin where the ring used to be.<br> <br>The building has an address, but it&#x2019;s certainly neither a place to live nor a home. On the floor are two rectangular plastic boxes for balcony flowers, but the hostel room doesn&#x2019;t have a balcony. Britt-Marie has no one to sit up all night waiting for.<br> <br>But she sits up anyway.</p><h2>Point Blank (FBI Thriller)</h2><p>Barely surviving a motel bombing while trying to rescue a kidnapped entertainer, FBI agents Dillon Savich and Dane Carver find themselves working against an unstable villain with designs on their families and fellow agents, while agent Ruth Warnecki follows leads about a lost treasure and a murdered music school student to the site of hidden cave. 500,000 first printing.

Outer Hebrides, 600 acres. . . . Puffins and seals. Apply."&#x2014;and thus found the Shiants. With a name meaning "holy or enchanted islands," the Shiants for millennia were a haven for those seeking solitude, but their rich, sometimes violent history of human habitation includes much more. When he was twenty-one, Nicolson inherited this almost indescribably beautiful property: a landscape, soaked in centuries-old tales of restless ghosts and Bronze Age gold, that cradles the heritage of a once-vibrant world of farmers and fishermen.</p><p>In <em>Sea Room</em>, Nicolson describes and relives his love affair with the three tiny islands and their strange and colorful history in passionate, keenly precise prose&#x2014;sharing with us the greatest gift an island bestows on its inhabitants: a deep engagement with the natural world.</p></p><p><p>Adam Nicols on is the author of <em>Seamanship</em>, <em>God's Secretaries</em>, and <em>Seize the Fire</em>. He has won both the Somerset Maugham and William Heinemann awards, and he lives with his family at Sissinghurst Castle in England.</p>For his 21st birthday, Nicolson's father gave him some islands among the Scottish Outer Hebrides, 600 acres worth of land that the elder Nicolson had purchased on a whim in 1937. At various times, the Sussex-based writer recalls, the Shiant islands "have been the most important thing in my life," and he has produced a vivid, meticulously researched paean to his "heartland," examining its geology, its flora and fauna, and its history as he reminisces about his own idylls there. The islands, now uninhabited except by the Nicolsons, are outcroppings of grass and rock and stark black cliffs, surrounded by churning waters that are notoriously difficult to negotiate. Until 1901, they were continuously inhabited for thousands of years by an eighth-century hermit, medieval farmers, Irish Jacobite rebels and others documented by Nicolson. The islands are also an important breeding station for birds, and Nicolson observes the comings and goings of geese, puffins and razorbills. Throughout the book, Nicolson explores the troubling idea of ownership; Hebrideans view English landowners with a mix of resentment and derision, and Nicolson acknowledges that his rights to the islands, like those of previous landlords, are morally ambiguous. His mix of scholarship, reflection and lyrical description brings his beloved atolls to life, and the genre-bending book should win some fans among those interested in nature writing and memoir. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>True Devotion to Mary: A Consecration to Jesus Through the Blessed Mother</h2><p><p><b><i>Written long ago, but equally as relevant, True Devotion to Mary,</i> Saint Louis de Montfort's classic text<i>,</i> provides a guide&nbsp;to consecrating yourself to Jesus through Mary.</b><br><br> Saint Louis de Montfort was a French priest whose devotion to Mary made him one of the <b>earliest writers on the subject of Mariology</b>.

Beautifully designed and presented in a deluxe hardcover edition ... uke can&#39;t go wrong with this book!</p><p>"Visual" is the key word in the title of this thoroughly engaging look at a whimsical, diminutive instrument that's had much more influence on pop music and culture than one would initially guess. With its elaborate illustrations and eye-popping, color-drenched photos of ukuleles, famous players and manufacturers, sheet music and a wide variety of other memorabilia, The Ukulele traces the history of the instrument from its birth to present day with a fun text that's equally rich in trivia and history. As the instrument moves from turn of the century Hawaii to popularity on the Mainland, it helped boost tourism in Hawaii, influenced Tin Pan Alley songwriters and performers as diverse as Arthur Godfrey, Tiny Tim and Joni Mitchell, and became a key icon in advertising, even when the product had nothing to do with ukuleles. Author Beloff, the associate publisher of Billboard magazine, has written several ukulele songbooks and recorded a CD of original ukulele songs, and there couldn't be a better tour guide for time travel through the evolution of this wacky little instrument. His profiles of some of the great ukulele players and key manufacturers are particularly interesting, and he presents an intriguing look at Hawaii as a culture through the images projected of its most famous export to the rest of the world.

In the year 1838, a young adventurer, surrounded by his native troops and mounted on an elephant, raised the American flag on the summit of the Hindu Kush and declared himself Prince of Ghor, the heir to Alexander the Great. Josiah Harlan, the first American to set foot in Afghanistan, would become the model for Kipling&#39;s &#39;The Man Who Would be King&#39;, but the true story of his life is stranger than fiction. A soldier, spy, doctor, naturalist and writer, Harlan set off into the wilds of Central Asia after a failed love affair in 1820. Following a brief stint as a surgeon in the East India Company&#39;s army, he joined the court of the deposed Afghan monarch Shah Shujah, and then slipped into Kabul disguised as a Muslim priest to foment rebellion. For the next two decades he would play a pivotal role in the bloody politics of the region. As commander of the Afghan army, he became the first general since Alexander the Great to lead an army across the Hindu Kush. There, in a crowning act of imperial hubris, he declared himself a prince. But a year later he was on his way back to America, unceremoniously ousted by an invading British army. He would die in obscurity in San Francisco, still boasting to sceptical listeners that he had once been an Afghan king. Harlan was an extraordinary mixture of parts: eccentric, inquisitive and brave to the point of lunacy, he was also an acute observer who understood the Afghan people as no foreigner had done before. His warnings of the dangers of imperialism have an uncanny echo at a time when relations between the West and Afghanistan are under intense scrutiny. Using a trove of newly discovered documents, including Harlan&#39;s long-lost journals, Ben Macintyre has followed Harlan&#39;s footsteps to uncover an astonishing, untold chapter in the history of the Great Game.</p><p>Ben Macintyre is the author of Forgotten Fatherland, The Napoleon of Crime, A Foreign Field and Agent Zigzag.

But on this particular morning, he never returned. With his disappearance, Jaffe left behind many unanswered questions&#x2014;not only about the cause of his death but also about the nature of his architectural legacy.<br><br> <i>Romantic Modernist: The Life and Work of Norman Jaffe, Architect</i> is the first book to explore Jaffe's body of work and the inner struggle that shaped his life. One of the earliest architects to be treated as a sex symbol, Jaffe was, in fact, much more than that. A magnetic, free-spirited individual, he is best known for the strikingly sculptural houses he designed in the Hamptons, which he approached from an almost mystical point of view: with the right proportions and materials, he believed, houses provide a path to self-discovery. Through interviews with Jaffe's closest friends and associates, Alastair Gordon traces Jaffe's career trajectory from his early years on the West Coast through his increasingly celebrated life in New York, giving readers a rare look at the creative process of this seductive, enigmatic architect.</p><p>Alastair Gordon is an award-winning journalist, architecture critic, and curator, whose work has been published in the New York Times, Vanity Fair, Town &amp; Country, House &amp; Garden, Architectural Record, Conde Nast Traveler, Dwell, and the New York Observer.

This is a sweeping and relentlessly exciting epic that tells the story of an invasion of Midkemia by a deadly army of trolls and renegade humans commanded by dark elves and an evil magical cabal--and chronicles the courage of a traitor elf who rejects the brutal plans of his warlike kind to cast his lot with the targets of their aggression. Master fantasist Feist works his singular magic once again, as he thrills us with the breathtaking exploits of daring defenders who stand firm and strong against the horrifying devastation aimed at the beating heart of their kingdom.</p><p>The video game industry has always drawn upon works of fiction for inspiration--sooner or later, the process had to reverse itself. <i>Krondor the Betrayal</i> began its life as the bestselling role-playing video game of all time, written by Raymond E. Feist for Dynamix Inc. Feist, whose <i>Serpentwar Saga</i> has sold millions of copies and established him as one of the most popular fantasy authors of modern times, also wrote this novelization which places the action of the game in the context of his fully-realized fantasy setting, Midkemia. <p>Feist's fans are legion. Longtime readers will be delighted at the return of popular characters Pug the Wizard, Squire Locklear, and others, as they face the menace of a marauding elf war-chieftain and a mysterious cabal of wizards. But first-time Feist readers may find <i>Krondor the Betrayal</i> baffling and tiresome--without the momentum of the larger series, much of the story's effect is diminished. The video game influence in this book is unmistakable--as evidenced by an encumbrance of sword fights, multilevel conspiracy, and two-dimensional characters. Anyone who enjoys reading about Midkemia will be thrilled to play the demonstration version of the CD-ROM game (included with the book). <i>--Brendan J. LaSalle</i></p>The RiftWar is done. But a fearsome army of trolls and renegade humans, emboldened by the drug of destruction, has risen in strength from the ashes of defeat. There is one, however, who defies the call to battle...<p>New York Times bestselling fantasist RAYMOND E. FEIST returns to a beleaguered realm of wonders and magic -- where war is an enduring legacy; where blood swells the rivers and nourishes the land. Attend to this hitherto untold chapter in the violent history of Midkemia -- a towering saga of great conflicts, brave acts and insidious intrigues. It is the story of a traitor who rejects the brutality of his warlike kind and casts his lot with the human targets of their fierce aggression. It tells of mysterious deaths and sinister machinations -- and sings of a time when the fate of many civilizations rested in the able, unfaltering hands of RiftWar veterans Squire Locklear and cunning thief-turned-squire Jimmy the Hand. It chronicles the powerful awakening of Owyn -- apprentice magician of untried strengths -- and celebrates the selfless achievements of Pug, the greatest sorcerer of two worlds. Welcome now to astonishing new corners of a world you have not yet fully explored -- and prepare to experience true excitement, blood-chilling terror...and the triumph born from the doom aimed at the beating heart of a kingdom.</p></p><h2>Eric Sloane&#39;s America</h2><p>This book combines three titles: American Barns and Covered Bridges; Our Vanishing Landscape; and American Yesterday.

The Peter Principle, the eponymous law Dr. Laurence J. Peter coined, explains that everyone in a hierarchy-from the office intern to the CEO, from the low-level civil servant to a nation&#39;s president-will inevitably rise to his or her level of incompetence. Dr. Peter explains why incompetence is at the root of everything we endeavor to do-why schools bestow ignorance, why governments condone anarchy, why courts dispense injustice, why prosperity causes unhappiness, and why utopian plans never generate utopias. With the wit of Mark Twain, the psychological acuity of Sigmund Freud, and the theoretical impact of Isaac Newton, Dr. Laurence J. Peter and Raymond Hull&#39;s The Peter Principle brilliantly explains how incompetence and its accompanying symptoms, syndromes, and remedies define the world and the work we do in it.</p><p></p><h2>Dragon Wytch</h2><p>The D&#39;Artigo sisters are half-human, half-Fae operatives for the Otherworld Intelligence Agency.

The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling's spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling's fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. <p> The heart of Book 7 is a hero's mission--not just in Harry's quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore's warning about making the choice between "what is right and what is easy," and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling's skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. </p><p> A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix's flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> </p><p> <strong>Deluxe Edition Details</strong> <br>The Deluxe Edition includes an exclusive insert featuring near-scale reproductions of Mary GrandPr�'s interior art, as well as never-before-seen full-color frontispiece art on special paper.

Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists. <br>* Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards.<br>* Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* The de-gnoming of the Weasleys' garden. Harry discovers that even wizards have chores--gnomes must be grabbed (ignoring angry protests "Gerroff me! Gerroff me!"), swung about (to make them too dizzy to come back), and tossed out of the garden--this delightful scene highlights Rowling's clever and witty genius. <br>* Harry's first experience with a Howler, sent to Ron by his mother. <br>* The Dueling Club battle between Harry and Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart starts the Dueling Club to help students practice spells on each other, but he is not prepared for the intensity of the animosity between Harry and Draco. Since they are still young, their minibattle is innocent enough, including tickling and dancing charms. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Ron's attempt to use a telephone to call Harry at the Dursleys'. <br>* Harry's first encounter with a Dementor on the train (and just about any other encounter with Dementors). Harry's brush with the Dementors is terrifying and prepares Potter fans for a darker, scarier book. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's behavior in Professor Trelawney's Divination class. Some of the best moments in Rowling's books occur when she reminds us that the wizards-in-training at Hogwarts are, after all, just children. Clearly, even at a school of witchcraft and wizardry, classes can be boring and seem pointless to children. <br>* The Boggart lesson in Professor Lupin's classroom. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's knock-down confrontation with Snape. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Hermione's disgust at the reception for the veela (Bulgarian National Team Mascots) at the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling's fourth book addresses issues about growing up--the dynamic between the boys and girls at Hogwarts starts to change. Nowhere is this more plain than the hilarious scene in which magical cheerleaders nearly convince Harry and Ron to jump from the stands to impress them. <br>* Viktor Krum's crush on Hermione--and Ron's objection to it. <br>* Malfoy's "Potter Stinks" badge. <br>* Hermione's creation of S.P.E.W., the intolerant bigotry of the Death Eaters, and the danger of the Triwizard Tournament. Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series. Candy and tickle spells are left behind as the students tackle darker, more serious issues and take on larger responsibilities, including the knowledge of illegal curses.</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* Harry's outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming. <br>* Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone. <br>* Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager. <br>* Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape. <br>* Dumbledore's confession to Harry.</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* The introduction of the Horcrux. <br>* Molly Weasley asking Arthur Weasley about his "dearest ambition." Rowling has always been great at revealing little intriguing bits about her characters at a time, and Arthur&#x2019;s answer "to find out how airplanes stay up" reminds us about his obsession with Muggles.<br>* Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore, and more time spent with the fascinating and dangerous pensieve, arguably one of Rowling&#x2019;s most ingenious inventions.<br>* Fred and George Weasley&#x2019;s Joke Shop, and the slogan: "Why Are You Worrying About You-Know-Who? You Should Be Worrying About U-NO-POO--the Constipation Sensation That's Gripping the Nation!"<br>* Luna's Quidditch commentary. Rowling created scores of Luna Lovegood fans with hilarious and bizarre commentary from the most unlikely Quidditch commentator.<br>* The effects of Felix Felicis.</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>Magic, Mystery, and Mayhem: A Conversation with J.K.

J.K. Rowling is very descriptive in her writing--she gives an illustrator a lot to work with. Each story is packed full of rich visual descriptions of the atmosphere, the mood, the setting, and all the different creatures and people. She makes it easy for me. The images just develop as I sketch and retrace until it feels right and matches her vision." Check out more <i>Harry Potter</i> art from illustrator Mary GrandPr�. <br><br></p><p>J. K.

Specifically, it is the story of the Samashki Massacre, a symbol of the Russian brutality that was employed to crush Chechen resistance. <br> <br>Thomas Goltz is a member of the exclusive journalistic cadre of compulsive, danger-addicted voyeurs who court death to get the story. But in addition to providing a tour through the convoluted Soviet and then post-Soviet nationalities policy that led to the bloodbath in Chechnya, <i>Chechnya Diary</i> is part of a larger exploration of the role (and impact) of the media in conflict areas. And at its heart, <i>Chechnya Diary</i> is the story of Hussein, the leader of the local resistance in the small town that bears the brunt of the massacre as it is drawn into war. <br><br>This is a deeply personal book, a first person narrative that reads like an adventure but addresses larger theoretical issues ranging from the history of ethnic/nationalities in the USSR and the Russian Federation to journalistic responsibility in crisis zones.<i> Chechnya Diary</i> is a crossover work that offers both the historical context and a ground-level view of a complex and brutal war.<br></p><p>Thomas Goltz is the author of <i>Azerbaijan Diary</i> and is currently resident in Livingston, Montana and Istanbul, Turkey.<br>Chechnya Diary<br>PART ONEThe observer affects the observed.&nbsp;<br>- ESSENCE OF THE HEISENBERG UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLECHECHNYA DIARY.

It has created a new, unprecedented cultural space that we are all a part of&#x2015;even if we don&#x2019;t participate, that is how we participate&#x2015;but by which we&#x2019;re continually surprised, betrayed, enriched, befuddled. We have churned through platforms and technologies and in turn been churned by them. And yet, the internet is us and always has been.</p><p>In <i>Lurking</i>, Joanne McNeil digs deep and identifies the primary (if sometimes contradictory) concerns of people online: searching, safety, privacy, identity, community, anonymity, and visibility.

It is a story we are accustomed to hearing as tales of entrepreneurs and visionaries and dynamic and powerful corporations, but there is a more profound, intimate story that hasn&#x2019;t yet been told.</p><p>Long one of the most incisive, ferociously intelligent, and widely respected cultural critics online, McNeil here establishes a singular vision of who we are now, tells the stories of how we became us, and helps us start to figure out what we do now.</p></p><p><b>Joanne McNeil</b> was the inaugural winner of the Carl &amp; Marilynn Thoma Art Foundation&#x2019;s Arts Writing Award for an emerging writer.

This poetic, empathetic, and incisive history of the Internet will resonate deeply with anyone who goes online to listen and learn, not shout and grandstand. Never cynical or reductive, McNeil traces the commercialization of the digital world in unexpected and insightful ways, revealing what has been lost and stolen and what utopian possibilities might still be recovered.

Jews around the world share other foods as well - such as pomegranates, pumpkins, beets, and dates - foods that grow abundantly and symbolize prosperity. Author Rahel Musleah, who grew up in Calcutta, India, presents a Sephardic Rosh Hashanah seder observed throughout the world.

She enriches the vibrant mosaic of Jewish diversity with her distinctive lyrical and literary voice.&nbsp;</p>Grade 2-6&#x2013;A guidebook for celebrating the Jewish New Year. Noting that seder means "order," and that the traditional foods are eaten in a prescribed sequence after specific blessings, the author includes a combination of both traditional Ashkenazic (Eastern European) and Sephardic (Spanish and Middle Eastern) foods symbolizing prosperity. Blessings are included for apples and honey, as well as for dates; pomegranates; green beans; pumpkin or gourd; beetroot leaves; leeks, scallions, or chives; and lettuce. Each chapter gives a history of the fruit or vegetable as related to the Talmud, the blessing, a related story, activity, recipes, and "Think" boxes offering concepts and ideas that encourage meaningful family discussions through motivating questions. Watercolors in fall hues&#x2013;oranges, yellows, browns, and greens&#x2013;against muted tan or gold backgrounds accentuate the ideas and stories presented. An interesting and international approach to an important holiday.<i>&#x2013;Rita Soltan, Oakland University, Rochester, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But the high stress, unforgiving job took an irreparable toll on his psyche. After a despondent father murders his wife and son and takes his own life, Talley hits bottom. His marriage ends, he resigns from SWAT, and he struggles to escape from his former life by taking the chief-of-police job in a sleepy, affluent bedroom community far from the chaos and crime of Los Angeles.</p><p></p><p>But Talley's pursuit of peaceful small-town life is about to change when three young men, fleeing the robbery of a mini-mart, invade a tightly secured home, and take the family hostage. Plunged back into the high-pressure world that he has desperately been trying to put behind him, Talley finds his nightmare has barely begun, because this isn't just any house. It belongs to a brilliant white-collar criminal who launders money for L.A.'s renegade franchise of La Cosa Nostra. And the accountant's records of the incriminating money trail that lie within will put L.A.'s most lethal and volatile crime lord, Sonny Benza, behind bars. As Talley desperately tries to save the innocents inside, the full weight of Benza's wrath descends on him, putting Talley and his own family at risk. Soon, all involved are held hostage by the exigencies of fate and the only one capable of diffusing the crisis is the least stable of them all.</p><p></p></p><p>Robert Crais is the real thing: a writer who keeps topping himself. Last year, after eight popular books featuring private eye Elvis Cole (including <i>L.A. Requiem</i> and <i>Voodoo River</i>), he produced <i>Demolition Angel</i>, his first standalone suspense novel. Its complex, multidimensional hero was a damaged cop haunted by her past failures. It worked in that book, and it works even better in this one.<p> Jeff Talley, the police chief in a small Southern California town, still has nightmares about the young hostage who died when he made the wrong call in his previous job as a negotiator for an LAPD SWAT team. Now, three smalltime punks go on the run after a grocery store robbery and killing in Talley's town. Soon his deputies have surrounded the house where the inept robbers have taken Walter Smith and his two children hostage, and Talley's back in his worst dream again: until the county sheriff's full-fledged SWAT team arrives and takes over, he has to negotiate for their lives.</p><p> Crais keeps the point of view moving from Talley to the punks to the hostages as the situation unfolds in the house and on the ground. Then he ratchets up the dramatic tension: there's something in Walter Smith's house that a ruthless Mob boss wants, and he'll sacrifice anyone to get it--which puts Talley's own family in danger. The action speeds to its climax with the velocity of a heat-seeking missile, which makes it almost criminal to slow down long enough to savor the great writing. Take this passage, from a scene when Talley's face-to-face with the man who's holding his own wife and daughter hostage: </p><blockquote> Talley ... had stepped into the Zone. It was a place of white noise where emotions reigned and reason was meager. Anger and rage were nonstop tickets; panic was an express. He had been all day coming to this, and here he was: the SWAT guys used to talk about it. You went to the Zone, you lost your edge. You'd lose your career; you'd get yourself killed, or, worse, somebody else. </blockquote> Crais belongs in that tier of writers whose novelistic gifts transcend the thriller category--writers like Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, and James Lee Burke. <i>Hostage</i> is a breakout. <i>--Jane Adams</i>The bestselling author of Demolition Angel" and L.A. Requiem" returns with his most intense and intricate thriller yet. <br>As the "Los Angeles Times said, Robert Crais is "a crime writer operating at the top of his game." His complex heroes and heroines, his mastery of noir atmosphere, and his brilliant, taut plots have catapulted him into the front rank of a new breed of thriller writers. Hostage" proves his earlier success was no fluke. It's an unstoppable read. <br>An ex-con with delusions of grandeur and his tagalong brother unwittingly team up with a psychopath one wrong word away from meltdown. When their late afternoon joyride turns into a random act of violence, they take a family hostage in the affluent bedroom community of Bristo Camino. Enter Chief of Police Jeff Talley, a stressed-out former LAPD SWAT negotiator who is hiding from his past. Plunged back into the high-pressure world that he desperately wants to forget, Talley soon learns that his nightmare has only begun. <br>The hostages are not who they seem, and the home contains secrets that even L.A.'s most lethal and volatile crime lord, Sonny Benza, fears. As Talley tries to hold himself together and save the people inside, the full weight of Benza's wrath descends on him, putting the police chief and his own family at risk. Soon, all involved are held hostage by the exigencies of fate and the only one capable of diffusing the standoff is the least stable of them all. <br>Hostage is a blistering stand-alone thriller with superb characters in crisis, multistranded plotting, and pitch-perfect Southern California sensibility. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Before We Kill And Eat You: Tales of Faith in the Face of Certain Death</h2><p><p>In 1920, Henry B. (H.B.) Garlock and some months later his bride, Ruth, traveled to West Africa to bring the gospel to a place known as "the white man's grave."&nbsp; <i>Before We Kill and Eat You</i> tells the Garlocks' fascinating real-life story of faith and calling in the face of malaria, cannibals and witch doctors.&nbsp; Readers will be inspired and encouraged by tales, as if taken straight from the book of Acts, of blind men healed and of people raised from the dead.&nbsp; Though many of their colleagues before them succumbed to death, H.B. and Ruth persevered in the midst of unbelievable hardship to reap an incredible harvest of believers that continues to this day.&nbsp; <b>RECOVER</b> <b>ONLY</b><br></p></p><p><p> In a land called "the white man's grave," the only insurance against malaria, cannibals and death was faith in God... </p><p> "[The Pahn warriors] made a mad rush toward me with drawn knives, shouting "Kill him. Kill him!" The leader lunged at me with his cutlass raised to behead me. When it seemed the end had come and my head was about to be severed from my body, I closed my eyes and committed myself to God, repeating over and over again the one name that is above every name, "JESUS, JESUS!" Suddenly there was a deathlike stillness."</p><b>H.B. GARLOCK</b> (1897-1985) originally wrote this book with the editorial assistance of his daughter-in-law <b>RUTHANNE GARLOCK</b>, who has revised it for a new generation of readers. "As you read 'Before We Kill and Eat You', you will relive the exciting missionary adventures of H.B. Garlock, a wonderful servant of God who labored in Africa more than 80 years ago. In a sense, you will be transported back to the Book of Acts where the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit was manifested on a regular basis." - Jim Cymbala, The Brooklyn Tabernacle.<br><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Death of the Liberal Class</h2><p>The liberal class plays a vital role in a democracy. It gives moral legitimacy to the state. It makes limited forms of dissent and incremental change possible. The liberal class posits itself as the conscience of the nation. It permits us, through its appeal to public virtues and the public good, to define ourselves as a good and noble people. Most importantly, on behalf of the power elite the liberal class serves as bulwarks against radical movements by offering a safety valve for popular frustrations and discontentment by discrediting those who talk of profound structural change. Once this class loses its social and political role then the delicate fabric of a democracy breaks down and the liberal class, along with the values it espouses, becomes an object of ridicule and hatred. The door that has been opened to proto-fascists has been opened by a bankrupt liberalism<br><br><b>The Death of the Liberal Class</b> examines the failure of the liberal class to confront the rise of the corporate state and the consequences of a liberalism that has become profoundly bankrupted. Hedges argues there are five pillars of the liberal establishment &#x2014; the press, liberal religious institutions, labor unions, universities and the Democratic Party&nbsp;&#x2014; and that each of these institutions, more concerned with status and privilege than justice and progress, sold out the constituents they represented. In doing so, the liberal class has become irrelevant to society at large and ultimately the corporate power elite they once served.</p><p>Chris Hedges, currently a senior fellow at The Nation Institute, a Lecturer in the Council of the Humanities and the Anschutz Distinguished Fellow at Princeton University, spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in Central America, the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans. Hedges has reported from more than 50 countries and has worked for <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>, National Public Radio, <i>The Dallas Morning News</i> and <i>The New York Times</i>, where he spent fifteen years. He is the author of the best-selling <b>War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning</b>, which draws on his experiences in various conflicts to describe the patterns and behavior of nations and individuals in wartime. Hedges, the son of a Presbyterian minister, has a B.A. in English Literature from Colgate University and a Master of Divinity from Harvard University. He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard during the academic year of 1998-1999. He has a strong grounding in the classics and knows Greek and Latin, as well as Arabic, French and Spanish. He currently writes for numerous publications including <i>Foreign Affair</i>.<b>I / Resistance<br></b><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>To allow the market mechanism to be sole director of the fate</i><br><i>of human beings and their natural environment, indeed,</i><br><i>even of the amount and use of purchasing power, would</i><br><i>result in the demolition of society.

A large American flag is strapped to the side of his green backpack. There is a light drizzle and he is wearing a green Army poncho. Short, muscular, and affable, with his brown hair in a close military crop, Bell tells me when I stop my car that he is on a six-day, ninety-mile, self-styled &#x201c;Liberty Walk&#x201d; from Binghamton to Utica. He plans to mount a quixotic campaign to challenge Democratic incumbent Rep. Michael Arcuri in the 24th Congressional District as the Republican candidate. Bell has camped out along the road for three nights and stayed in cheap motels the other nights. He opposes the health-care bill recently passed by the Democratic-majority Congress, calls for an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, advocates the abolishment of the Federal Reserve, is against the Federal Government&#x2019;s Wall Street bailouts, and wants to see immediate government relief for workers, including himself, trapped in prolonged unemployment. He carries a handwritten sign: &#x201c;End the Fed,&#x201d; echoing the title of a book by U.S. Representative Ron Paul he keeps in his backpack, along with a copy of <i>U.S. Constitution for Dummies </i>by Michael Arnheim. He says he plans to deliver Paul&#x2019;s book to Arcuri&#x2019;s office in Utica.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I just walked through the town of Norwich,&#x201d; he says as a car passes and the driver honks in support, &#x201c;and there is a strong Tea Party movement there&#x201d;:<br>&nbsp;<br>The Tea Party movement, for the most part, is just a bunch of disgruntled<br>Americans. They know something is wrong and they are<br>ready to be engaged. A lot of the people in my area who are in the Tea<br>Party are Democrats. People are confused. They are shell-shocked.<br>They don&#x2019;t know what to think. But acting like these problems started<br>January 20 [the date of the presidential inauguration] is absurd. To<br>single out the current president and not the presidents before him is<br>not productive for trying to figure out what is going on.2<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell, who lives in Lansing, New York, is the new face of resistance. He is young, at home in the culture of the military, deeply suspicious of the Federal Government, dismissive of the liberal class, unable to find work, and angry. He swings between right-wing and left-wing populism, expressing admiration for both Paul and U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, as well as the Tea Party movement. He started out as a supporter of John McCain in the last presidential election but soured on the Arizona senator and the Republican Party&#x2019;s ties to Wall Street. He ended up not voting in that election. He has raised about $1,000 from neighbors and friends for his own campaign. Adept at martial arts, he made it to the semifinals of the 2010 Army National Guard Combative Championship at Fort Benning in Georgia, where, in his last bout, he suffered a broken nose, bruised his opponent&#x2019;s ribs and thighs, and lost in a split decision.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am truly terrified when I think about our future,&#x201d; he says:<br>&nbsp;<br>I believe all signs point to a real systemic economic collapse in the<br>near future, maybe even before the midterm elections. I believe this is<br>why many incumbents are stepping down. They seem to know what<br>is coming and of course the rats are jumping ship and taking their<br>pensions with them. There will be nothing the government or the Fed<br>can do to slow the pain, no more tricks in the bag. I assure you it&#x2019;s<br>going to hurt everyone, except of course, the corporate and banking<br>elite. I say let the empire collapse; sometimes we must die to be<br>reborn. The political system as it stands offers little hope for influencing<br>real change or social justice. I propose we attempt to reverse this<br>coup d&#x2019;�tat by attempting a coup of our own. First, we must try to<br>retake the traditional means of control, power and discourse by<br>restoring integrity to our sold-out democratic election system. Unfortunately,<br>this will probably do little good but it is a worthy effort. It is<br>our patriotic duty to resist tyranny. We must break these chains of<br>oppression and restore our government to principles based on liberty<br>and justice for all. I am not confident that standing outside buildings<br>with signs is going to provide any fundamental power shifts, as power<br>is not often transferred without a struggle. Inalienable rights are not a<br>courtesy of the Federal Government. We must stand in the streets and<br>refuse to be silenced. We must reject corporate-controlled politics<br>and focus on rebuilding a localized political structure and society. A<br>revolution is the only alternative to complete surrender and defeat.<br>Cold, hard suffering and pain will be the only hope for a real revolution,<br>and this is all but guaranteed. At this point protest must be<br>transformed into acts of defiance. We must be bold.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell grew up in Oakwood, a small town in East Texas between Dallas and Houston. His father struggled with alcoholism and is now in recovery. His parents, who frequently fought, separated, and reunited, divorced when Bell was thirteen. His mother was left to raise Bell, along with his younger brother (currently in the Army&#x2019;s 82nd Airborne Division) and his younger sister in a one-bedroom apartment. There was little money, and his mother worked sporadically at odd jobs. There were eighteen people in his high-school graduating class. With few jobs in Oakwood, Bell, along with several of his classmates, joined the military.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My father worked two jobs to support us; he suffered from the disease of alcoholism but is a good guy and tried to be supportive father,&#x201d; Bell says:<br>&nbsp;<br>My mom had her own set of problems. She is now living in a oneroom<br>shack. She had breast cancer four years ago and has no insurance<br>and is living in poverty. I know the system is not working. She<br>lives at the little house, a one-bedroom cabin on her mother&#x2019;s land,<br>where me and my brother lived off and on when my parents were<br>arguing. We lived in several different houses and apartments with<br>both my mom and dad. I left home when I was seventeen, drifting<br>between friends&#x2019; houses, then moved back to Oakwood, where I finished<br>high school, living with my grandparents, who had a profound<br>effect on my life and values. My life was inconsistent, chaotic, and<br>working-class. I believe this environment helped develop my character<br>and perspective. I have to give credit where it&#x2019;s due. My dad tried.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t stay in Oakwood, Texas, and have a job,&#x201d; he adds.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell moved to upstate New York two years ago after leaving the Marine Corps to be near Shianne, his three-year-old daughter. He and the girl&#x2019;s mother are separated. Bell found work as a carpenter with a traveling construction crew. He earned $14.50 an hour and could sometimes make as much as $800 a week. Then the financial meltdown knocked the wind out of the local economy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Everybody in my apartment building has had their hours cut, are unemployed, or have taken minimum-wage jobs,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I was laid off last year. I try to find work as an independent carpenter. I don&#x2019;t have health insurance.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The dearth of work, which left him attempting to survive at times on $600 a month, saw him enlist last year in the New York National Guard, even though it means almost certain deployment to Afghanistan. The enticement of a $20,000 signing bonus was too lucrative to pass up. The National Guard unit he joined recently returned from a tour in Afghanistan.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We are training to go back to Afghanistan,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;The fact that they are still using Army National Guard, state-level troops, to police the streets of Afghanistan is not good. These units are really overstretched. We do not get the benefits. We don&#x2019;t get health insurance like active-duty military. But the guard gets deployed just as much. Some of these guys have been on three and four tours.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I got out of the Marine Corps and went back to Texas for ten months and was involved in the John McCain campaign,&#x201d; he says:<br>&nbsp;<br>I really got disillusioned with the neoconservatism.

Reviewing the fighting in every Filipino province, he finds that the American victory was due more to rebel mistakes and American "social reform" than to overwhelming American military force.

Its effects on our view of life have been wide and deep. One of the most world-shaking books ever published, Charles Darwin&#x2019;s <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, first appeared in print over 130 years ago, and it touched off a debate that rages to this day.</p><p>Every modern evolutionist turns to Darwin&#x2019;s work again and again. Current controversies in the life sciences very often have as their starting point some vagueness in Darwin&#x2019;s writings or some question Darwin was unable to answer owing to the insufficient biological knowledge available during his time. Despite the intense study of Darwin&#x2019;s life and work, however, many of us cannot explain his theories (he had several separate ones) and the evidence and reasoning behind them, nor do we appreciate the modifications of the Darwinian paradigm that have kept it viable throughout the twentieth century.</p><p>Who could elucidate the subtleties of Darwin&#x2019;s thought and that of his contemporaries and intellectual heirs&#x2015;A. R. Wallace, T. H. Huxley, August Weismann, Asa Gray&#x2015;better than Ernst Mayr, a man considered by many to be the greatest evolutionist of the century? In this gem of historical scholarship, Mayr has achieved a remarkable distillation of Charles Darwin&#x2019;s scientific thought and his enormous legacy to twentieth-century biology. Here we have an accessible account of the revolutionary ideas that Darwin thrust upon the world. Describing his treatise as &#x201c;one long argument,&#x201d; Darwin definitively refuted the belief in the divine creation of each individual species, establishing in its place the concept that all of life descended from a common ancestor. He proposed the idea that humans were not the special products of creation but evolved according to principles that operate everywhere else in the living world; he upset current notions of a perfectly designed, benign natural world and substituted in their place the concept of a struggle for survival; and he introduced probability, chance, and uniqueness into scientific discourse.</p><p>This is an important book for students, biologists, and general readers interested in the history of ideas&#x2015;especially ideas that have radically altered our worldview. Here is a book by a grand master that spells out in simple terms the historical issues and presents the controversies in a manner that makes them understandable from a modern perspective.</p></p><p>Our current controversies very often have as their starting point some vagueness in Darwin&#39;s writings or a question Darwin was unable to answer owing to the insufficient biological knowledge available in his time. But one returns to Darwin&#39;s original writings for more than historical reasons. Darwin frequently understood things far more clearly than both his supporters and his opponents, including those of the present day.Ernst Mayr was Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology, Emeritus, at Harvard University. He was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees and awards, including the Crafoord Prize for Biology, the National Medal of Science, the Balzan Prize, and the Japan Prize.</p><h2>Fisher-Price Little People Easter Is Here!

She was 53 years old before she was able to speak the words in public, "I am an incest survivor." She opened the door for tens of thousands of sexual abuse survivors to also speak the words, many for the first time, within their own families and communities. <p>Marilyn describes, in detail, what specific "work" she did on her journey from victim to survivor. After learning of a woman&#x2019;s rape, Marilyn heard a close friend say, "It was a bad 20 minutes." In the hope that rape and sexual abuse will no longer be as easily dismissed or minimized, Marilyn writes for the first time about what her father did to her and what the impact has been on her adult life. </p><p>Using her story as the scaffolding, she shares knowledge and insights she has gained through speaking personally with adult survivors across the country. Marilyn has been in personal contact with more survivors than anyone in America. She has personally answered over 8,000 letters and spoken in 225 cities. Survivors line up for two to three hours to tell her their stories. </p><p>Marilyn&#x2019;s major motivation in writing the book came as a result of hearing these words, literally thousands of times: "When I was 7 and my brother was 13..." Only the ages changed. </p><p>The most frequently reported age when sexual abuse begins is between 5 and 6 years old and common offenders are older brothers and teenage baby-sitters (both male and female). 14 -year-olds comprise the largest number of sex offenders of any age group. </p><p>With her extensive research on the long-term impact of trauma and her belief that prevention is the best weapon for keeping our children safe, Marilyn urges parents to talk with children, as young as five, and provides suggested guidelines for important conversations that will, hopefully, evolve into continuous dialogues. </p><p>Knowing that vulnerable children are targets, she gives unique ways of building children&#x2019;s self esteem. </p><p>Read how she responds to: "This happened decades ago." "How could you forget?" "Are there really &#x2018;false memories&#x2019;?" "Can &#x2018;just fondling&#x2019; cause as much trauma as rape?" "Did you forgive?" "How did you develop a satisfying sexual relationship?" The major theme that ties the book together is how her marriage continued to thrive during her darkest years of recovery.</p></p><p>Won 1st place in the prestigious Writers Digest national competition. 1900 books were entered in 9 categories.

Won 3 more awards from the Colorado Independent Publishers Association.Anyone who knew Marilyn Van Derbur as a child and young adult believed she had it all. Born into an affluent, prominent family, she was a popular, out-standing student and athlete. But beneath the surface, she suffered from horrific panic attacks, unrelenting insomnia and excruciating body pain. No one could imagine that her father &#34;incested&#34; her from age five to 18. Van Derbur was an overachiever with a subconscious need to stay constantly busy. She realizes now that this was a coping mechanism to keep her two worlds separated - the &#34;night child&#34; who suffered at the hands of her father and the &#34;day child&#34; who was happy and accomplished. While a sophomore in college, her sorority sisters nominated her for Miss University of Colorado. Three months later, she was crowned Miss America. Ignoring the sheer terror she felt at the prospect of speaking in front of others, Van Derbur chose motivational speaking as her career and, within a decade, she was named &#34;Outstanding Woman Speaker in America.&#34; Believing people would look at her with disgust and distain if they knew her secret, Van Derbur had an obsessive need to be successful and respected. As her life unfolded, she began to understand the complex ways in which her childhood trauma was driving her adult life. Through dogged persistence and gut-wrenching disclosures and confrontations, she began to heal the gaping wounds of her childhood. When a newspaper reporter learned of her story, Van Derbur&#39;s private shame became front-page news. When she landed on the cover of People magazine, there was a national outpouring from survivors who turned to her for help and support. It became instantly clear that her new role was to help others who had suffered from rape and sexual abuse and to help educate parents on how to keep their children safe from predators.</p><h2>Glass Houses</h2><p><p>Glass homes represent the intersection between the outdoor and the indoor&#x2014;the public and the private.

Fashion historian and costume and set designer Vasilliev narrates the history of the Russian emigration in Istanbul, Paris, Berlin, and the eastern Russian port of Harbin, before detailing, chapter by chapter, the fashion houses set up by TmigrTs, various cloth designers, Russian handicrafts, and Russian models from WWI into the 1950s. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>This unique, first-of-its-kind treatment of the influence of Russian migr s upon women's fashions during the early 20th century is breathtaking in depth and scope. Enhanced by over 840 black-and-white photographs and illustrations, the text describes successful accomplishments of dozens of Russian houses of couture prolific during the 1920s and 1930s in Paris, Constantinople, Berlin, and Harbin in far-off China. Forced to support themselves, noble Russian refugees employed what they knew best: elegance, style, and good taste. One, Valentina, found success in the United States, dressing Garbo and other film actresses. Characteristic Russian decorations and embroideries derived from Slavic and Eastern sources excited wealthy clientele who had been primed for things " la Russe" even before the Revolution by the dazzling exports of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and Art Moderne, the Russian version of Art Nouveau. Erte, the fashion illustrator, and beautiful and elegant women who modeled added to the richness of culture contributed by Russians to the modern history of fashion. The author is himself a costume and set decorator and fashion historian. This absorbing book is essential for all public and academic fashion and design collections and will be of interest to Slavic and Russian studies students. Very highly recommended.DTherese Duzinkiewicz Baker, Western Kentucky Univ. Libs., Bowling Green <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.Before and after the Russian Revolution, thousands of Russian emigres fled for their lives to the European capitals. The wealthiest and most cultured of this very wealthy and cultured set arrived (and usually remained) in Paris, often bringing with them pieces of the lavish life they led in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and beyond. Their exotic patterns, often inspired by oriental themes, sometimes in the form of curtains and sofa covers, were the last vestiges of the court life they once held so dear. Many of these emigres had to find work for the first time in their lives, and they turned to what they knew best--the world of fashion. This comprehensive work shows in astonishingly beautiful photographs the fashion and influence that the emigre communities had on the rest of the world and on what the rich and famous would wear for decades. Vassiliev's work not only chronicles the world of their fashion but also is a comprehensive look at emigre communities themselves. <i>Michael Spinella</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Thousands of kids loved Queenie, celebrated her birthday, and sent her letters. But in an event still not fully understood, Queenie crushed one of her keepers in late 1944. Was she mistreated or bored? Was it an accident? No one knows, but zoos have changed since Queenie&#x2019;s time. Plainspoken and honest, this gentle account shows the good, the bad, and the evolution of zoo philosophy. Queenie&#x2019;s story is a thought-provoking steppingstone for discussion of a complex, difficult topic.<br>Back matter includes an author&#x2019;s note.</p><p><b>Corinne Fenton</b> is the author of more than fifteen children&#x2019;s books, but <i>Queenie: One Elephant&#x2019;s Story</i> is her first picture book.

He lives in Tasmania.Gr 1-3&#x2013;As a baby elephant, Queenie was stolen from her mother in India and transported to the Melbourne Zoo. At the age of nine, she was trained to carry passengers on her back for almost 40 years. Intelligent and well loved, Queenie was the main attraction at the zoo and an icon in Melbourne until she crushed one of her keepers in 1944. Whether it was an accident or not will never be known, but the tragedy, paired with a wartime food shortage, marked the end for Queenie, who was put to sleep in the summer of 1945. The truth is hard, and this historical tale is filled with sadness. The final spread introduces the natural habitat now provided for elephants at Melbourne Zoo and invites readers to remember Queenie in happier times in her native India. Hauntingly beautiful illustrations capture the time period and the affection and admiration bestowed upon her. Though the plight of decades of zoo animals can be found here, this is also a story about the love for one memorable animal. This title would best be shared with a caring adult with plenty of conversation to follow.&#x2013;Heather Acerro, Rochester Public Library, MN&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Inspired as a child by <em>Grimm's German Fairy Tales</em> and <em>The Arabian Nights</em>, he decided as an adult to write and illustrate stories for children. After some success contributing to children's magazines, he became famous with his book <em>The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood of Great Renown in Nottinghamshire</em>. He also wrote and illustrated historical romances and fairy stories.</p>Men of Iron<br>CHAPTER 1Myles Falworth was but eight years of age at that time, and it was only afterwards, and when he grew old enough to know more of the ins and outs of the matter, that he could remember by bits and pieces the things that afterwards happened; how one evening a knight came clattering into the court-yard upon a horse, red-nostrilled and smeared with the sweat and foam of a desperate ride--Sir John Dale, a dear friend of the blind Lord.Even though so young, Myles knew that something very serious had happened to make Sir John so pale and haggard, and he dimly remembered leaning against the knight's iron-covered knees, looking up into his gloomy face, and asking him if he was sick to look so strange. Thereupon those who had been too troubled before to notice him, bethought themselves of him, and sent him to bed, rebellious at having to go so early.He remembered how the next morning, looking out of a window high up under the eaves, he saw a great troop of horsemen come riding into the court-yard beneath, where a powdering of snow had whitened everything, and of how the leader, a knight clad in black armor, dismounted and enteredthe great hall doorway below, followed by several of the band.He remembered how some of the castle women were standing in a frightened group upon the landing of the stairs, talking together in low voices about a matter he did not understand, excepting that the armed men who had ridden into the courtyard had come for Sir John Dale. None of the women paid any attention to him; so, shunning their notice, he ran off down the winding stairs, expecting every moment to be called back again by some one of them.A crowd of castle people, all very serious and quiet, were gathered in the hall, where a number of strange men-at-arms lounged upon the benches, while two billmen in steel caps and leathern jacks stood guarding the great door, the butts of their weapons resting upon the ground, and the staves crossed, barring the door-way.In the anteroom was the knight in black armor whom Myles had seen from the window. He was sitting at the table, his great helmet lying upon the bench beside him, and a quart beaker of spiced wine at his elbow. A clerk sat at the other end of the same table, with inkhorn in one hand and pen in the other, and a parchment spread in front of him.Master Robert, the castle steward, stood before the knight, who every now and then put to him a question, which the other would answer, and the clerk write the answer down upon the parchment.His father stood with his back to the fireplace, looking down upon the floor with his blind eyes, his brows drawn moodily together, and the scar of the great wound that he had received at the tournament at York--the wound that had made him blind--showing red across his forehead, as it always did when he was angered or troubled.There was something about it all that frightened Myles, who crept to his father's side, and slid his little hand into the palm that hung limp and inert. In answer to the touch, his father grasped the hand tightly, but did not seem otherwise to notice that he was there. Neither did the black knight pay any attention to him, but continued putting his questions to Master Robert.Then, suddenly, there was a commotion in the hall without, loud voices, and a hurrying here and there. The black knight half arose, grasping a heavy iron mace that lay upon the bench beside him, and the next moment Sir John Dale himself, as pale as death, walked into the antechamber. He stopped in the very middle of the room. "I yield me to my Lord's grace and mercy," said he to the black knight, and they were the last words he ever uttered in this world.The black knight shouted out some words of command, and swinging up the iron mace in his hand, strode forward clanking towards Sir John, who raised his arm as though to shield himself from the blow. Two or three of those who stood in the hall without came running into the room with drawn swords and bills, and little Myles, crying out with terror, hid his face in his father's long gown.The next instant came the sound of a heavy blow and of a groan, then another blow and the sound of one falling upon the ground. Then the clashing of steel, and in the midst Lord Falworth crying, in a dreadful voice, "Thou traitor! thou coward! thou murderer!"Master Robert snatched Myles away from his father, and bore him out of the room in spite of his screams and struggles, and he remembered just one instant's sight of Sir John lying still and silent upon his face, and of the black knight standing above him, with the terrible mace in his hand stained a dreadful red.It was the next day that Lord and Lady Falworth and little Myles, together with three of the more faithful of their people, left the castle.His memory of past things held a picture for Myles of old Diccon Bowman standing over him in the silence of midnight with a lighted lamp in his hand, and with it a recollection of being bidden to hush when he would have spoken, and of being dressed by Diccon and one of the women, bewildered with sleep, shuddering and chattering with cold.He remembered being wrapped in the sheepskin that lay at the foot of his bed, and of being carried in Diccon Bowman's arms down the silent darkness of the winding stair-way,with the great black giant shadows swaying and flickering upon the stone wall as the dull flame of the lamp swayed and flickered in the cold breathing of the night air.Below were his father and mother and two or three others. A stranger stood warming his hands at a newly-made fire, and little Myles, as he peeped from out the warm sheepskin, saw that he was in riding-boots and was covered with mud. He did not know till long years afterwards that the stranger was a messenger sent by a friend at the King's court, bidding his father fly for safety.They who stood there by the red blaze of the fire were all very still, talking in whispers and walking on tiptoes, and Myles's mother hugged him in her arms, sheepskin and all, kissing him, with the tears streaming down her cheeks, and whispering to him, as though he could understand their trouble, that they were about to leave their home forever.Then Diccon Bowman carried him out into the strangeness of the winter midnight.Outside, beyond the frozen moat, where the osiers stood stark and stiff in their winter nakedness, was a group of dark figures waiting for them with horses. In the pallid moonlight Myles recognized the well-known face of Father Edward, the Prior of St. Mary's.After that came a long ride through that silent night upon the saddle-bow in front of Diccon Bowman; then a deep, heavy sleep, that fell upon him in spite of the galloping of the horses.When next he woke the sun was shining, and his home and his whole life were changed.All new material copyright � 2006 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC</p><h2>Capone: The Man and the Era</h2><p>The real man emerges from behind the legend in a portrait of the notorious gangster that includes the little-known story of his older brother--a lawman and Prohibition officer--and brings to life the 1920s and 1930s in America. 40,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Laurence Bergreen is an award-winning biographer and historian. His books have been translated into twenty-five languages worldwide. Among his books are biographies of Christopher Columbus, Giacomo Casanova, Marco Polo, Ferdinand Magellan, Louis Armstrong, Al Capone, and Irving Berlin. He lives in New York City.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br><br><b><i>Campanilismo</i></b><br><br>He was atavistic, flamboyant, impossible to ignore. A big fat man with a cigar and a $50,000 pinkie ring. A jowly smiling Satan nearly six feet tall, with two scars across his left cheek. He weighed over two-fifty, yet despite his bulk and the sloppy grin, he could move with lethal speed and force. Not an articulate man, he was nonetheless charismatic: warm, charming, generous. A big tipper. He attempted elegance with an outrageous wardrobe -- custom-tailored suits of purple, electric blue, or yellow; pearl-gray fedoras accented by a black band; and diamond-encrusted stickpins. He liked people, wanted them to adore him, and people gravitated toward him, they applauded him, sought his autograph, and as he excused himself as a businessman or a rogue, he submitted to their hero worship and condemnation.<br><br>His name was Al Capone, and he was, according to the <i>New York Times</i> on the occasion of his death, January 25, 1947, "the symbol of a shameful era, the monstrous symptom of a disease which was eating into the conscience of America. Looking back on it now, this period of Prohibition in full, ugly flower seems fantastically incredible. Capone himself was incredible, the creation of an evil dream."<br><br>Incredible. Fantastic. Ugly. Evil. In harsh, censorious language the obituaries attempted to explain, condemn, and, perversely, revel in his life and career. They informed the public that "Alfonso Caponi" had been born in Naples in 1895, as if no American lad could ever grow up to be so evil. They evoked his apprenticeship to crime in Manhattan's Little Italy, in particular, a neighborhood known as the Mulberry Street Bend; reproduced his draft card; mentioned his service during the Great War as part of the French "Lost Battalion" and described the duel -- though some accounts referred to shrapnel -- which gave him the two famous scars across his left cheek. They confided that his nickname was "Scarface"; explained that the young Capone fled a murder rap in New York and arrived in Chicago one step ahead of the police to work for his cousin Johnny Torrio, vice lord of that city. They portrayed him as the mastermind behind the notorious St. Valentine's Day Massacre on February 14, 1929; in some accounts he even wielded a machine gun himself. They gave as the cause of his death pneumonia or a stroke, or a combination of the two; and, finally, they unanimously claimed his death marked the end of an era of gangsters and murder in Chicago and around the country. Thus his life became a paradigm of the gangster's progress in America.<br><br>However, nearly all of this endlessly repeated -- and generally accepted -- information was erroneous, beginning with the time and place of his birth. So, too, was the story of his military service in the Great War; the often-reproduced draft card actually belonged to another Al Capone, a butcher who resided in New Jersey. The manner in which he received his scar was similarly falsified and romanticized, as was his real nickname ("Scarface" was strictly for the movies and newspapers), the true cause of his death, even the correct spelling of his name. Nor did his demise mark the end of gang-land, as his moralizing obituaries predicted; powerful racketeers followed Capone as surely as they had preceded him. "You who only know him from newspaper stories will never realize the real man he is," his younger sister, Mafalda, publicly stated, but her words fell on deaf ears or met with outright derision; was she not blinded by family loyalty? And then there were the movies and later the television programs inspired by his career, which served to increase the confusion surrounding his deeds and reputation, since these dramatizations endowed characters engaged in largely fictional exploits with the names of real people. Ultimately, the Al Capone who became familiar to Americans is a myth: a poisonous but intoxicating blend of the shrill yellow journalism of the 1920s, Hollywood sensationalism, and pervasive anti-Italian prejudice. These multiple distortions transformed Capone into a larger-than-life symbol of evil.<br><br>For decades American politicians and writers had been warning the populace about Al Capone -- or someone very much like him -- as an example of the alien element contaminating clean native shores with disease, throwing the nation's economy into turmoil with cheap labor, and corrupting Anglo-American institutions with rapacious feudal codes. The Capone phenomenon, according to such voices, was the natural and inevitable outcome of the nation's permitting millions of immigrants from around the world to flow into the country during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Among the most influential critics of unrestricted immigration was a Republican member of Congress from Massachusetts, the Honorable Henry Cabot Lodge. The scion of a wealthy family, a historian, and a former editor of the respected <i>North American Review,</i> Lodge personified the political, economic, and financial establishments of his day; well could he presume to decide whom to admit to the United States and whom to exclude. In 1891, three years before Capone's parents arrived in New York, this flower of New England warned that during the previous fifteen years alone, almost 6.5 million immigrants had poured into the country, a number "equal to one-tenth of the entire population of the country," a sum, he warned, that contained "enough voters to decide a presidential election." Lodge wanted them to stay away for precisely the reasons they wished to come, because they were impoverished, uneducated, without a secure place in the world. "We have the right to exclude illiterate persons from our immigration," he insisted, and he proposed screening the millions of undesirables washing up on American shores with a literacy test, a notoriously elastic gauge. "And this test," he concluded, "combined with others of a more general character, would in all probability shake out a large part of the undesirable portion of the present immigration. It would reduce in a discriminating manner the number of immigrants, and would thereby benefit the labor market." Later in the year, Lodge warned that the United States had become a haven for the "paupers and criminals" of Europe. "It is certainly madness to permit this stream to pour in without discrimination or selection, or the exclusion of dangerous and undesirable elements," by which he meant, specifically, Italians, who, he noted, simply came to this country to earn money and then returned home to spend it, enriching their countrymen at the expense of Americans. Despite Lodge's warning and an 1882 federal law excluding paupers and criminals, immigration continued almost unchecked, inhibited only by the Great War. "We are overwhelmed, submerged and almost drowned out by great flood-tide of European riff-raff, the refuse of almost every nation on the continent, paupers, criminals, beggars and the muddy residuum of foreign civilizations," complained the <i>New York Herald.</i> "We don't wonder that they want to come to this country, but the country is not a philanthropic institution or an asylum for the crippled and depraved of the globe....The sooner we take a decided stand and shut down the gates the better." Not until 1924 did Congress finally establish a quota system for immigrants.<br><br>Each immigrant group suffered from this intense bias in its own way, but one of the cruelest stereotypes to gain currency -- and beyond that, intellectual respectability -- was that of Southern Italians like the Capones, who were invariably portrayed as lazy, lusty, stupid, and criminal. Writing in the <i>Century Magazine</i> as late as 1914, Edward Alsworth Ross, a prominent sociologist, gave voice to the beliefs of America's ruling class concerning the disreputable new arrivals, especially those who came, like Al Capone's parents, from Naples. "Steerage passengers from Naples," Ross observed, "show a distressing frequency of low foreheads, open mouths, weak chins, poor features, skew faces, small or knobby crania, and backless heads. Such people lack the power to take rational care of themselves; hence their death-rate in New York is twice the general death-rate." Too unintelligent to survive, or so Ross believed, Southern Italians also displayed a want of"mechanical aptitude." In addition, "their emotional instability stands out in sharpest contrast to the self-control of the Hebrew and the stolidity of the Slav." As for their children, their exasperated American teachers agreed that they "hate study, make slow progress, and quit school at the first opportunity....They are very weak in abstract mathematics." Coming to the New World only worsened these problems, Ross believed. They were far better off in their own country, among their own kind, he insisted. "Who can forget the joyous, shameless gregariousness of Naples?" Ross asked, where "the streets are lively with chatter and stir and folks sitting out in front and calling one another." They like it there in the slums of Naples, he supposed, where the illiterate peasants "covet the intimacies of the tenement-house." (Even that observation, intended as a compliment, held sinister implications.) In contrast to the typical Southern Italian, Ross described those national character traits he admired: "The man who 'sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not' is likely to be a German..., an Englishman with his ideal of <i>truth,</i> or an American with his ideal of <i>squareness."</i><br><br>Even the champions of the impoverished immigrants despaired at the inability of Italian arrivals to improve themselves, find employment, become educated, in short, to <i>assimilate.</i> Among the most influential was Jacob Riis, himself an immigrant who had abandoned a comfortable background in Denmark to venture to the United States. In his career as a crusading journalist with the <i>New York Evening Sun</i> and a social reformer, he displayed righteous anger at the disgraceful living conditions imposed on the newest Americans, especially children, but when he came to Italians, he portrayed them not as casualties of the appalling social conditions afflicting all immigrants, but as victims of their own flawed natures. Unlike Lodge, whose xenophobia was largely an intellectual proposition, Riis based his impressions of Italian immigrants on direct personal observation. In his otherwise progressive book, <i>How the Other Half Lives</i> (1890), Riis wrote that the Italian who comes to New York "promptly reproduces conditions of destitution and disorder which, set in the framework of Mediterran exuberance, are the delight of the artist, but in a matter-of-fact American community become its danger and reproach....The Italian comes in at the bottom...and stays there."<br><br>The harsh view shared by respected politicians and journalists had as its street equivalent a single word summing up what so many Americans thought of Italians: dago. A corruption of <i>Diego</i> (Spanish for James), the derisive epithet originated in the American West and worked its way back East, where it extended to the new Italian arrivals, who were often pitifully unaware of the climate of hatred and resentment awaiting them in America.<br><br>As Southern Italians, they had been accustomed to prejudice from the Northern provinces of their own country; indeed Northern Italians could be just as contemptuous of their Southern compatriots as Henry Cabot Lodge and Jacob Riis were. For Northerners, Italy consisted of two countries, the North and the South, or perhaps even three: the North, the South, and Sicily -- the latter province being so alien, backward, corrupt, and feudal that the Northerners referred to the Sicilians as Africans, a term that had little to do with the Sicilians' appearance but much to do with fears about their character. (As an adult trying to survive in the fiercely contested rackets, Capone came to share the non-Sicilians' fear of the "Black Italians" who dominated the business; "those crazy Sicilians" became his common complaint.) In addition to the virulent prejudice they faced at home, Southern Italians were also plagued by natural disasters; there were earthquakes, there were droughts, there were even volcanic eruptions -- all of which suggested that farmers and other peasants who made their living from the land had best flee for their lives. As a result, they kept on coming despite the extreme hostility they faced in America, and their numbers shot past the levels that had so concerned Henry Cabot Lodge. In 1880, approximately 12,300 Italians came to the United States; only eight years later, the number reached over 51,000, more than a fourfold increase. During the 1890s, Italian immigration averaged about 50,000 souls a year; and in the following decade, the first of the new century, the numbers exploded: 100,000 in 1900, 230,000 in 1903, 286,000 in 1907. The figures remained at these tremendous levels until the Great War impeded civilian transatlantic travel. Nothing -- not the threat of war between the United States and Italy or the hovels awaiting them in "Little Italys" around the nation -- deterred the Italians from coming to a land bristling with transplanted historical hatred for them. Their willingness to brave these hardships was testament to their desperation, their courage, their na�vet�, and their great hopes for life in America -- hopes that, more often than not, were to lead to conflict and bitter disappointment.<br><br>The youth of Al Capone, as with many other sons and daughters of Italian immigrants, was largely a response to this climate of anti-Italian prejudice. He and his brothers would all devise different responses; some of the strategies would prove more admirable than others, but none of them would escape it.<br><br>Al Capone always insisted he was an American, born and bred, and so he was, but his Italian heritage formed and informed every aspect of his life and career. He belonged both to the Old World -- with its fatalism, corruption of flesh and spirit, and charm -- and to the New -- with its striving, materialism, and violence.<br><br>His mother, a seamstress named Teresina Raiola, and his father, a barber named Gabriele Capone, grew to maturity, married, and started their family in Naples. Italy's third-largest city, located on the western coast approximately halfway between Rome and the boot's toe, Naples sprawls down to the ocean like a brightly colored, tattered and soiled dishrag. Neapolitans are renowned for their ability to improvise and adapt; they have to, living in a city hemmed in by Mount Vesuvius on one side and the Tyrrhenian Sea on the other, a capital that had been changing hands for over two thousand years. At one time or another, Greeks, Romans, Austrians, Spaniards, and the French (in the person of Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother) ruled the city; for a time during the eighteenth century, it had served as the seat of an improvised nation, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. As a result of this ceaseless upheaval, the city had the air of an abandoned capital that had fallen into chaos; where kings once walked, herds of sheep later grazed. "There is nothing...quite like Naples in its sordid and yet tremendous vitality," wrote Edward Hutton, an English visitor, of the city in 1915. The noise, dirt, and overcrowding appalled the fastidious Hutton; Naples seemed more "a pen of animals than a city of men, a place amazing if you will, but disgusting in its amazement, whose life is...without dignity, beauty or reticence."<br><br>However, Neapolitans enjoyed a reputation for being singularly accepting and relaxed in the midst of the dirt and chaos of their city. They had seen too much of history's folly to heed the Catholic Church; resentful of the North, or at least mindful of the North's resentment of them, Neapolitans te...</p><h2>Runaway Girl: The Artist Louise Bourgeois</h2><p>Introduces the life of renowned modern artist Louise Bourgeois, who is known primarily for her sculptures.</p><p>Jan Greenberg and Sandra Jordan have collaborated on best-selling, critically acclaimed books about Chuck Close, Frank O. Gehry, and Vincent van Gogh. Jan Greenberg is also the author of Abrams'<i> Heart to Heart: New Poems Inspired by Twentieth-Century American Art</i>, a Michael L. Printz Honor Book. She lives in St. Louis. Sandra Jordan, an editor and photographer as well as a writer, lives in New York City.*Starred Review* Gr. 8-12. As in <i>Frank O. Gehry, Outside In</i> (2000), the authors once again make challenging art accessible and exciting to teen readers. This time they focus on Louise Bourgeois, one of the best-known living sculptors, whose work deals with primal themes of jealousy, betrayal, and shifting sexual identities, which, according to Bourgeois are inspired by her painful childhood and her adulterous father. In clear, elegant prose, bolstered with numerous quotes from the artist, the authors seamlessly juxtapose stories of Bourgeois' life with relevant artworks, which are often explained in the artist's own words. Beautifully reproduced photographs, printed on well-designed pages, offer an excellent mix of the artist's personal life and her art, though the authors remind readers that "we don't have to know her story to have our own strong reaction," to her work. By showing the relationship among shapes, colors, materials, and emotions, the authors invite readers to approach even the most bewildering art with confidence and think about it in their own words. The book concludes with a glossary, a bibliography, and notes. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I'm making myself seek to find the wild form, that can grow with my wild heart . . . because now I know MY HEART DOES GROW." &#x2014;Jack Kerouac, in a letter to John Clellon Holmes <p> Written in 1951-52, <b>Visions of Cody</b> was an underground legend by the time it was finally published in 1972. Writing in a radical, experimental form ("the New Journalism fifteen years early," as Dennis McNally noted in <b>Desolate Angel</b>), Kerouac created the ultimate account of his voyages with Neal Cassady during the late forties, which he captured in different form in <b>On the Road</b>. Here are the members of the Beat Generatoin as they were in the years before any label had been affixed to them. Here is the postwar America that Kerouac knew so well and celebrated so magnificently. His ecstatic sense of superabundant reality is informed by the knowledge of mortality: "I'm writing this book because we're all going to die. . . .

Irwin describes, in general terms, how he came to be an astronaut and the years of training that followed. In recounting the mission, Irwin writes in the present tense without overdramatizing. He shares some lighter moments with readers, and places as much emphasis on how he feels as on what he does. It's a spiritual journey for Irwin, too: not only does he feel the presence of God in the lunar creation around him, and the sense that he will have another mission after Apollo, but God speaks to him directly, helping him deal with a minor equipment failure.

Will California soon hold the balance of power in Mexican national politics? Will Latinos reinvigorate the US labor movement?<br><br>These are some of the provocative questions that Mike Davis explores in this fascinating account of the Latinization of the US urban landscape. As he forefully shows, this is a demographic and cultural revolution with extraordinary implications. With Spanish surnames increasing five times faster than the general population, salsa is becoming the predominant ethnic rhythm (and flavor) of contemporary city life. In Los Angeles, Houston, San Antonio, and (shortly) Dallas, Latinos outnumber non-Hispanic whites; in New York, San Diego and Phoenix they outnumber Blacks. According to the Bureau of the Census, Latinos will supply fully two-thirds of the nation&#x2019;s population growth between now and the middle of the 21st century when nearly 100 millions Americans will boast Latin American ancestry.<br><br>Davis focuses on the great drama of how Latinos are attempting to translate their urban demographic ascendancy into effective social power. Pundits are now unanimous that Spanish-surname voters are the sleeping giant of US politics. Yet electoral mobilization alone is unlikely to redress the increasing income and opportunity gaps between urban Latinos and suburban non-Hispanic whites. Thus in Los Angeles and elsewhere, the militant struggles of Latino workers and students are reinventing the American left. Fully updated throughout, and with new chapters on the urban Southwest and the explodiing counter-migration of Anglos to Mexico, <i>Magical Urbanism</i> is essential reading for anyone who wants to grasp the future of urban America<br><br>This paperback edition of Mike Davis&#x2019;s investigation into the Latinization of America incorporates the extraordinary findings of the 2000 Census as well as new chapters on the militarization of the border and violence against immigrants.</p><p>Hispanics are quickly transforming the United States both through sheer numbers and their culture, according to Mike Davis. "Salsa is becoming the predominant ethnic flavor--and rhythm--in major metropolitan areas," he writes, and Spanish surnames are growing at five times the rate of the general population (Jos� is now the most popular name for baby boys in California and Texas). Davis, the author of <i>City of Quartz</i> and <i>Ecology of Fear</i>, says the United States is undergoing what he calls "Latin Americanization." In <i>Magical Urbanism</i>, which is short by comparison, he doesn't traffic in tired rhetoric about the magic of multiculturalism or the wonders of ethnic diversity--but he does come down hard against those who resist Latin Americanization. He writes of "an INS police state with sweeping powers away from the border," blasts the opponents of bilingual education, and hopes that Latino immigrants will rejuvenate the American labor movement. The book lacks a strong central thesis; it's more a collection of 15 essays, rich with anecdotes, on topics such as U.S. demographic trends, transnational neighborhoods, and "the Dickensian underworld of day labor." Old fans of Davis will definitely want to check out this latest offering, as will readers interested in a quick look at the face of America's future. <i>--John J.

By the author of The President&#39;s Plane Is Missing. Reprint.</p><p>The author of The President's Plane Is Missing and other books set in the skies goes underwater with his new suspense novel, a thriller with supernatural overtones. Discoveries made--but never fully divulged--by a diving team in 1975 are the impetus for a new expedition organized to explore the wreckage of the doomed luxury liner, which went to its watery grave in 1912. The scientists and treasure hunters involved in the 1993 expedition are aware that the previous venture was apparently cursed; strange atmospheric conditions eventually sank the research vessel, but not before its passengers had glimpsed some sort of monster protecting the Titanic hulk. The beast had no clear form, but presented itself as the deepest, most personal fear of each observer. Counting among its members the sole survivor of the previous effort, the new expedition is motivated by the knowledge that a fortune in gold bullion lies in the Titanic 's hold. Serling weaves bits of historical data into his narrative with too heavy a hand, but he does successfully skirt the issue of why the three real-life research trips to the Titanic in the 1980s never encountered the mysterious creature. Read with a suspension of disbelief, the book is a page-turner, the ending kept in doubt until the rousingly dramatic conclusion. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This novel reads like a mixture of a Stephen King ghost story and a Tom Clancy technothriller.

A 1975 expedition seeking to recover that lost fortune had found the sunken remains of the great liner, but a series of strange accidents and terrifying apparitions destroyed all but one of its members. Years later that survivor is asked to accompany a top-secret U.S. Navy mission to salvage the Titanic 's gold. The mission encounters a supernatural entity that will go to fantastic lengths to prevent the sunken ship from being looted. The deep-sea diving operations and Titanic lore provide diverting reading and compensate for a not-very-scary ghost story.

Some were literati of the so-called Romantic group; others were philosophers of the Buddhist/ Hegelian Kyoto school. Their topic of discussion was how to &#x201c;overcome the modern.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a time of nationalist zeal, and the intellectuals who attended the conference were all nationalists in one way or another; but oddly enough the war itself, in China, Hawaii, or Southeast Asia, was barely mentioned. At least one of the members, Hayashi Fusao, a former- Marxist-turned-ardent-nationalist, later wrote that the assault on the West had filled him with jubilation. Even though he was in freezing Manchuria when he heard the news, it felt as though dark clouds had lifted to reveal a clear summer sky. No doubt similar emotions came over many of his colleagues, but war propaganda was not the ostensible point of the conference. These men, the literary romantics as much as the philosophers, had been interested in overcoming the modern long before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their conclusions, to the extent that they had enough coherence to be politically useful, lent themselves to propaganda for a new Asian order under Japanese leadership, but the intellectuals would have been horrified to be called propagandists. They were thinkers, not hacks.<br><br>&#x201c;The modern&#x201d; is in any case a slippery concept, but in Kyoto in 1942, as in Kabul or Karachi in 2001, it meant the West. But the West is almost as elusive as the modern. Japanese intellectuals had strong feelings about what they were up against, but had some difficulty defining exactly what that was. Westernization, one opined, was like a disease that had infected the Japanese spirit. The &#x201c;modern thing,&#x201d; said another, was a &#x201c;European thing.&#x201d; There was much talk about unhealthy specialization in knowledge, which had splintered the wholeness of Oriental spiritual culture. Science was to blame. And so were capitalism, and the absorption of modern technology, and individual freedoms, and democracy. All these had to be &#x201c;overcome.&#x201d; A leading film critic, Tsumura Hideo, excoriated Hollywood movies and praised the documentary films of Leni Riefenstahl about Nazi rallies, which were more in tune with his ideas on how to forge a healthy national community. In his view, the war against the West was a war against the &#x201c;poisonous materialist civilization&#x201d; built on Jewish financial capitalist power. All agreed that culture&#x2014;that is, traditional Japanese culture&#x2014;was spiritual and profound, whereas modern Western civilization was shallow, rootless, and destructive of creative power. The West, particularly the United States, was coldly mechanical. A wholistic, traditional, classical Orient, united under divine Japanese imperial rule, would restore the warm organic community to spiritual health. As one of the participants put it, the struggle was between Japanese blood and Western intellect.<br><br>The West, to Asians at that time, and to some extent still today, also meant colonialism. Since the middle of the nineteenth century, when China was humiliated in the Opium Wars, educated Japanese realized that national survival depended on careful study and emulation of Western ideas and technology. Never had a great nation embarked on such a radical transformation as Japan between the 1850s and 1910s. The main slogan of the Meiji Period (1868&#x2013;1912) was &#x201c;Bunmei Kaika,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Civilization and Enlightenment&#x201d;; that is, Western civilization and enlightenment. Everything Western, from natural science to literary realism, was hungrily soaked up by Japanese intellectuals. European dress, Prussian constitutional law, British naval strategies, German philosophy, American cinema, French architecture, and much, much more were taken over and adapted. The modern, then, referred to that &#x201c;European thing,&#x201d; but also to the Japanese effort to make it their own.<br><br>The transformation paid off handsomely. Japan remained uncolonized and quickly became a great power that managed, in 1905, to defeat Russia in a thoroughly modern war. Japan&#x2019;s industrial revolution did not come long after Germany&#x2019;s, with equally dislocating effects. Large numbers of impoverished country people moved into the cities, where conditions could be cruel. The army was a brutal refuge for rural young men, and their sisters were sometimes sold to big city brothels. But economic problems aside, there was another reason many Japanese intellectuals sought to undo the wholesale westernization of the late nineteenth century. It was as though Japan suffered from intellectual indigestion. Western civilization had been swallowed too fast. And that is partly why that group of literati gathered in Kyoto to discuss ways of reversing history, overcoming the West, and returning to an idealized spiritual past.</p><h2>Out of the Earth: Civilization and the Life of the Soil</h2><p>Describes the complex processes that for the soil, explains its role in civilizations since prehistoric times, and points out the dangers of abusing this valuable resource</p><p>"Daniel Hillel is a master at presenting complex scientific concepts in a dynamic, lively style. He also demonstrates unusual mastery in articulating the historical framework of the present crisis, providing a perspective on the peaks and valleys of the long-standing relationship between the soil and man."&#x2014;Shawki Barghouti, Chief of Agriculture Production and Services, The World BankCan the loss of soil fertility so affect a civilization that it ceases to exist? Yes, says Hillel, professor of soil physics at the University of Massachusetts. In this readable and easily accessible book, he begins by exploring ancient cultures to show that, far from being modern afflictions only, destructive farming practices and deforestation have been occurring with regularity for thousands of years. From Sumeria to Australia to China to America, Hillel impressively documents his thesis with example after example. More than a scholarly accounting, this book is passionate in its defense of the earth and the need for wise stewardship of its resources.

Too bad Dave's dad doesn't agree! Instead of enjoying long days of biking, swimming, and sitting around, Dave and his two best friends are being forced by their fathers into a summer of hard labor. </p><p>The friends have something else in mind, though: Not only will they not work over the summer, but they're determined to trick everyone into believing they really do have jobs. So what if the lifeguard doesn't have a tan or the fast-food worker isn't bringing home buckets of free chicken? There's only one problem: Dave's dad wants evidence that his son is actually bringing in money. And that means Dave, Curtis, and Victor will have to get some . . . without breaking the law and without doing any work! </p><p><em>Project Sweet Life</em> is designed for the funny and lazy bone in all of us&#x2014;a true comedy of errors (without any effort!) from seasoned storyteller Brent Hartinger.</p></p><p>Among Brent Hartinger's many books are <i>Geography Club</i>, which is now a feature film starring Scott Bakula, and <i>Double Feature</i>, winner of the Lambda Book Award.

As the boys glumly contemplate actual work, they decide to deceive their families, avoid employment, and live the sweet life for one last summer. Still, they need to figure out a way to make money, which they can pass off to their parents as hard-earned wages. In a series of ill-fated schemes that range from bank stakeouts to scuba diving, the boys weave a complicated and uncomfortable web of lies and rack up a large debt. At last, they try a desperate plan to locate stolen gold that plunges them into the China Tunnels, a remnant of a black time in the history of Tacoma, Washington. Hartinger&#x2019;s comedy of errors is improbable but entertaining. The characters ring true, and teens will appreciate that the trio puts more effort into evading work than they would have expended at a real job. An amusing story with great teen appeal.

For years, the case remained officially unsolved and it consumed the FBI and became a rallying point for launching the Iraq War. Far from Baghdad, at Fort Detrick, Maryland, stood Bruce Ivins: an accomplished microbiologist at work on patenting a next-generation anthrax vaccine.

It was a place where doors were left unlocked, where kids roamed without fear. The shops in the well- scrubbed downtown were family-owned. Malts and burgers were served at the soda fountains on Broadway. On the same street, Ohio&#x2019;s oldest inn and restaurant, the Golden Lamb, boasted of having entertained ten U.S. presidents, not to mention Henry Clay and Charles Dickens.<br>Founded as a stagecoach stop in the state&#x2019;s southwest corner, midway between Cincinnati and Dayton, the town of Lebanon (&#x201c;LEBB-in-in&#x201d;) grew into a bedroom community of several thousand. Farm kids mixed with classmates whose parents worked for National Cash Register, General Motors, and Frigidaire in Dayton, for General Electric or the German- family breweries in Cincinnati, the Armco Steel plant in Middletown, and the paper mills in Franklin.<br>Lebanon&#x2019;s nicest neighborhoods were just south of downtown, across the double-arch Turtle Creek Bridge, built in 1897. The first cross street up the hill from the bridge was Orchard Avenue, home to prominent families, including doctors and for a number of years the town&#x2019;s only municipal court judge.<br>The second-generation proprietor of Ivins-Jameson Drugs, a Lebanon fixture with roots in the nineteenth century, also landed on Orchard Avenue. T. Randall Ivins&#x2014;the T. stood for Thomas but most everyone called him Randall&#x2014;had been in no particular hurry to take on the mantle of the family business. Born in 1905 in Lebanon, Randall was raised on the high ground above Turtle Creek, known as South Broadway Hill. His was a childhood that could have been scripted by Mark Twain. He and his pals filled summer days with baseball in an open lot; they rode the trolley to the outskirts of Cincinnati to see Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West Show. Their favorite swimming hole was a clear-water stream within walking distance of their homes, in the woods of McBurney Hills. There they fished and made use of an aptly shaped tree stump to stash their corncob pipes and tobacco.<br>Randall left Ohio after the seventh grade to attend Princeton Preparatory School in New Jersey; he later majored in journalism at Wilmington College of Ohio and psychology at Princeton University. After graduating he worked as a cub reporter at the Commercial Tribune in Cincinnati, and as a public school teacher, eventually serving as principal of Lebanon&#x2019;s elementary school. It was said that his time as an educator had not been entirely successful&#x2014;he was simply too nice, incapable of imposing or maintaining discipline.1<br>In December 1933, Randall married twenty-six-year-old Mary Johnson Knight, a petite brunette who had earned a four-year degree in home economics from Florida Women&#x2019;s State College. Family lore held that the Knights were original settlers at Jamestown, that their genes were the stronger for having survived its hardships. Mary grew up in Brandon, Florida, near Tampa. She and Randall had met while he was vacationing in the North Florida Panhandle.2 Shortly after marrying, the new couple set about planning a family, and they hired an architect to build a home, at 26 Orchard Avenue, just around the corner from where Randall had grown up. The structure was single story with European flourishes, notably an ornamental turret that rose to the right of the front door.<br>With his marriage to Mary, Randall decided on a career in pharmacy. He enrolled in classes at the University of Cincinnati to get his state license and he began working at Ivins-Jameson Drugs, the family store founded in 1893 and still operated by his father, C. Wilbur Ivins, a charter member of the Lebanon Rotary Club. Randall had arrived none too soon. In January 1938, C. Wilbur died from a stroke while wintering with his wife in Sarasota, Florida. The store was left in the hands of his son and Clarence Jameson, whom the elder Ivins had trained and had taken on as his partner nineteen years earlier.<br>On April 22, 1946, Mary gave birth to the couple&#x2019;s third and final child, Bruce Edwards Ivins. His older siblings were Thomas, eleven, and Charles, &#x201c;C.W.,&#x201d; seven. Bruce would learn how to avoid Tom, who C.W. later suspected had grown to prefer the status of only child.3<br>Their brother, however, was not their biggest concern. Mary Ivins was prim, and comfortable using force to get her way. She was more than willing to impose whatever discipline the kindly Randall might shy away from. Her eruptions were frequent and could not always be predicted, though Bruce could see that C.W. made it a top priority to try to anticipate what was most likely to set her off.4<br>The Ivinses were well off by local standards and lived comfortably, while buying nothing on credit. The parents drove what C.W. called &#x201c;ocean liners,&#x201d; the heavy, smooth-riding sedans that defined the golden age of Detroit&#x2019;s Big Four. Color photographs captured some of the family&#x2019;s early moments together, including Christmas Eve 1947. Bruce, one year, eight months, is seen pressing keys on the family grand piano while his brothers watched. A snapshot from a year later shows C.W., Tom, and, to the right, Bruce, tightly clutching his brown teddy bear.5 By first grade, Bruce had devised an unusual way to play with it and other stuffed animals. He put blindfolds on them.6<br>Mary hovered over her youngest son, closely monitoring his academic progress and his interactions with other children. During his elementary school years, she always served as a room mother to Bruce&#x2019;s class. She and Randall also hosted elaborate, well-attended Halloween parties for Bruce and his classmates.<br>Apart from the gaiety of those parties, Mary Ivins ran the household like a boot camp. Her maxim for child rearing: &#x201c;Idle hands are the devil&#x2019;s workshop.&#x201d; C.W. later explained, &#x201c;Mom was one of these people that you had to justify your actions. So we learned always to have a reason for doing anything. If you acted on impulse you were gambling that you were going to get hit by lightning by impulse, too.&#x201d;7<br>Piano lessons were mandatory, and so was worship. Although Mary had been raised in the Southern Baptist church, she disliked the local Baptist preacher, so she and her sons attended Lebanon Presbyterian, where Pastor J. Taylor McHendry, &#x201c;Little Mac,&#x201d; presided. After church each Sunday, the boys were required to wear their suits and ties for a midday meal in the family&#x2019;s formal dining room, outfitted with mahogany furnishings, a Czech chandelier, and French wallpaper with velvetlike flocking. &#x201c;If Mom ever caught you feeling it, she would kill you,&#x201d; C.W. recalled. &#x201c;Mom could explode. She didn&#x2019;t know about the sliding switch that could adjust the illumination. It was either on or off. She inflicted terror on all of us.&#x201d;8<br>During summers Mary Ivins would load Bruce and C.W. into the family sedan and set out on weeks-long excursions while Randall stayed behind in Lebanon. She designed the trips to educate her two youngest sons about American history and geography. Mary&#x2019;s snapshots document some of the places they visited: the Grand Canyon, the Painted Desert, Yellowstone National Park, the Colorado Rockies, the Badlands in South Dakota, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.9 There also was a trip, in 1956, in which the family traveled through Princeton, New Jersey.10<br>C.W. was a partial buffer between Bruce and their mother. &#x201c;She just made him feel on edge, like she did everybody else,&#x201d; recalled Martha Leuzinger, who worked at the drugstore and saw a lot of Mary Ivins.11 When C.W. went to college, by which time Tom had been out of the house for several years, Bruce was left behind in a household thoroughly dominated by his mother, his home life grimmer than ever as he prepared to enter the sixth grade.<br>When her husband&#x2019;s older business partner, Clarence Jameson, died in 1959, Mary, who had been working part-time at the pharmacy, consolidated her influence at the renamed Ivins Drugs. She fired anyone she felt didn&#x2019;t meet her standards. While Randall continued to mix and fill the prescriptions, Mary took control of everything else. Always formally dressed, her hair set in a wave, she built up what was, for small-town Lebanon, a lavish line of high-end cosmetics, including Chanel No. 5. She made sure that the other products, including the cigars, the refrigerated display of Whitman&#x2019;s Samplers, and the horehound candy drops, kept up front in a wooden barrel, remained in ample supply.<br>&#x201c;When she came in, everybody was on their toes,&#x201d; said Jacqueline Sams, a student Mary had recruited as a part-time employee and whose brother was Bruce&#x2019;s friend. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t know what was going to set her off.&#x201d;12<br>One day she spotted a rumpled man sitting outside on the concrete steps and, obviously, down on his luck. As the store clerks watched, Mrs. Ivins filled a bucket with water, calmly strode out to the steps, pretended to stumble, and thoroughly drenched the man.13 On another occasion, suspecting that a couple of boys had done some minor vandalism to the Ivins residence, she waited until nightfall and, dressed in a disguise, splashed paint onto the side of the house where one of them lived.14<br>Bruce was a physically and socially awkward child, &#x201c;Bruce the Goose,&#x201d; as his irreverent classmate Larry Buchanan nicknamed him. A story from his grade school years recounts the time he was playing softball and got thwacked in the head by the ball, batted not by anyone resembling slugger Ted &#x201c;Big Klu&#x201d; Klus-zewski of the hometown Cincinnati Reds, but by a bookish and bespectacled girl, fellow fourth grader Elaine Kraus.15<br>While Randall Ivins had wandered freely as a boy, his youngest son was more comfortable with a chemistry set. Bruce took to wearing a plastic pocket protector, and he talked in rapid-fire bursts. He treasured the expensive microscope his parents bought him and he featured it in his ninth-grade science project. The instrument elevated Bruce from the crowd&#x2014;enabling him to see things that his classmates could not with their hobby-grade microscopes. When he walked he leaned forward from the waist, as if propelled by an inner purpose. He was a teenager so preoccupied that he didn&#x2019;t seem to notice what some classmates remember to this day&#x2014;the persistent knots of mucus suspended in his nostrils. With rare exception, he moved about Lebanon alone.16<br>Many of his peers at Lebanon High School found Bruce to be uncommonly high-strung, a boy who craved approval, yet struggled to fit in. Bob Edens passed by the Ivins residence every weekday afternoon and on weekends, delivering the Dayton Daily News on his sturdy Schwinn. Edens, a good enough student himself, thought Bruce was uniquely strange. &#x201c;He was very intelligent and made sure that everyone around him knew it,&#x201d; Edens recalled. &#x201c;He was a pain in the ass. He had an inability to become a part of the group in a natural way. So he would act out to get attention in weird ways. It was, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m here. Notice me.&#x2019; . . . He had no sense of normalcy. He was just a highly wound individual.&#x201d;17<br>Another classmate, Lana Neeley, a neighbor on Orchard Avenue, described what happened one day when her mother asked her to deliver something to the Ivins home. Lana was invited in, and as she waited for Mrs. Ivins, &#x201c;Bruce asked me if I wanted to come down to the basement and see the gunpowder he&#x2019;d just made.&#x201d; Lana, then fourteen, declined. She told her mother she would never set foot in the Ivins house again.18<br>One of Bruce&#x2019;s warmest relationships at Lebanon High was with a teacher, Dean Deerhake, a rail-thin man with a flattop haircut who crackled with enthusiasm. Deerhake taught junior year chemistry, and Bruce, who had excelled in biology the year before, was one of his top students. Ivins did not join the crowd easily, if at all, Deerhake recalled. &#x201c;Some of the questions he would ask would cause some of the other students to turn their heads. He was different. A little bit out in left field.&#x201d;<br>Deerhake himself was a bit different. He wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate to stand on a desk if he thought it might strike a chord with his charges. It was Deerhake who persuaded Bruce to try the cross-country team, which he coached after school. Cross-country provided a team framework for a solitary activity: training regularly over long distances and running two miles on race day through the Ohio countryside. Bruce Ivins wasn&#x2019;t fast enough to race with the varsity, but in the fall of 1963, his senior season, he once finished with a time of 13:47, placing him thirteenth among forty or more &#x201c;reserve,&#x201d; or junior varsity, runners.19<br>As Bruce&#x2019;s teacher and coach, Deerhake got to know his parents. He found Mary immediately intimidating, Randall just the opposite. The summer before Bruce&#x2019;s senior year, Randall approached Deerhake with a proposition, no doubt made possible by one of the pharmaceutical salesmen who regularly called upon Ivins Drugs: Would Mr. Deerhake be interested in driving Bruce up to the drug company&#x2019;s manufacturing plant in Michigan, for an insider&#x2019;s tour? It would be about a four- hour drive each way, entailing an overnight stay. The payoff would be a scientific opportunity for student and teacher&#x2014;a chance to observe firsthand the conversion of raw materials to finished medical products.<br>Deerhake said yes, and he and his wife drove Bruce to the plant in their blue Ford Custom sedan. They saw a movie (West Side Story), and Bruce seemed to relax on the road with the cheerful Deerhakes. He fit in as if he was their son.20<br>Bruce&#x2019;s isolation as a teenager was magnified by his struggle to communicate with the opposite sex. &#x201c;He was just a loner. He was so backward with women,&#x201d; said classmate Patricia McDaniel.21 His plight wasn&#x2019;t made any easier by his self-consciousness about his looks. Gaunt, with a forehead that rose tall and flat, his profile was unmistakable. He was not considered a handsome young man. &#x201c;His nose wouldn&#x2019;t be taken care of. He was just a duckling,&#x201d; said Ellen Leuzinger who was a year younger.22<br>In his pained social interactions at Lebanon High, Bruce was operating, as in most aspects of his life, in the long shadow of his mother. One of the few schoolgirls with whom he was friendly was Elaine Kraus, the same Elaine whose batted ball had hit Bruce in the head in the fourth grade. Whip-smart and toughened by life on her parents&#x2019; hundred-acre farm, Elaine was on a college-prep track, like Bruce. Both were members of the Current Events Club and the school newspaper staff, and they took part in campus stage productions.<br>Elaine, like so many others, viewed Bruce as nervous, hyper, &#x201c;almost socially backward.&#x201d; She noticed that sweat would bead on his forehead and he would become so stressed he could hardly sit still. To his &#x201c;Bruce the Goose,&#x201d; she was &#x201c;Elaine the Brain.&#x201d; Proud nerds before the term had currency, they were buddies of a sort, though Elaine felt no romantic attraction to him. And Bruce never hinted at such to her. None of which deterred Mary Ivins. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why you and Bruce aren&#x2019;t going out. You know, the two of you ought to get married.&#x201d; Elaine heard this from Mrs. Ivins whenever she saw her.23</p><h2>The Lost Years (Star Trek)</h2><p>Recounts the adventures of the crew of the Enterprise after they completed their original five-year mission, detailing how Kirk, McCoy, and Spock managed to enter into as much danger as they did when they were in space</p><p>After the end of the <i>Enterprise</i>TM's five-year mission, Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, and Dr. McCoy struggle to establish new lives apart from each other and the starship. The newly-promoted Admiral Kirk is placed in charge of a specially-created Starfleet division and attempts to defuse a critical hostage situation; Mr. Spock, who, in the midst of a teaching assignment on Vulcan, finds the one thing he least expected; and Dr. McCoy, whose unerring instinct for trouble lands him smack in the middle of an incident that could trigger an interstellar bloodbath.ENDAuthor of three previous Star Trek novels ( Mindshadow ; Demons ; Blood thirst ), Dillard also wrote the bestselling novelization of Star Trek: The Final Frontier . She credits DC Comics editor Bob Greenberger for the premise of this new installment in the saga. In a storyline constructed to fill in the gaps between the end of the original 1960s TV series and the beginning of the feature-length movie series, the Enterprise docks on Earth, ending its five-year mission, and Kirk, Spock and McCoy go their separate ways. Promoted from captain to admiral, Kirk receives an assignment as special envoy and "diplomatic troubleshooter" in his new role as head of a specially created Starfleet division. Unable to continue serving under Kirk, Spock returns to Vulcan for a teaching position at Vulcan Science Academy. McCoy resigns from the Fleet and then becomes involved with Dwen, a woman with psi talents. A tense hostage situation arises and, naturally, this reunites the Trek team. The contrast of strongly etched, familiar characters in an unpredictable sequence of events provides a situation certain to appeal to the series' fans. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Luck of the Irish: Our Life in County Clare</h2><p>In their fourth book, Williams and Breen, the authors of O Come Ye Back to Ireland, When Summer&#39;s in the Meadow, and The Pipes Are Calling chronicle their life and adventure in this beautiful country, where fewer and fewer Irish men and women are lucky enough to be able to live.</p><p>Ten years ago, the authors, who are husband and wife, moved to Ireland-Williams's homeland-from suburban New York City to live in a cottage in County Clare. Here they continue their adventures related in O Come Ye Back to Ireland and other books, with survival a central theme, as the couple and their two adopted children struggle to make a living in Kilmihil, with Williams working as a part-time English and French teacher and writing, while Breen takes care of the home, paints and writes. There is the eternal lament on the bad weather and the vanishing hope that it "might clear yet." There is the locals' suspicion of the flesh, with the scandal of topless dancing in Ballyferriter and the production of John B. Keane's "dirty play," The Chastitute. There is also the adventure of discovering western Ireland with a trip to Dingle, where the people of the Gaeltacht, the Irish-speaking region, talk "in foreign-sounding English." Ireland is also a fertile place: Williams's play, The Murphy Initiative, is staged at the Abbey Theater in Dublin and the family's horse foals. Readers will toast this book with a well-deserved slainte. Author tour. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.In several books (<i>O Come Ye Back to Ireland</i> and similarly clich{&#x201a;}e-entitled sequels), Williams and Breen recorded, in romantic detail, their escape from New York's rat race to a life in the west of Ireland that seemed every stressed-out American's dream--living in harmony with nature, surrounded by eloquent country folk, at peace with the world and themselves. Muttering cynics will love their new book, for, yup, Paddy, that life ain't what it seemed. A decade into it, Williams and Breen have given up the cows and taken part-time jobs. They struggle with the political and social tensions of their changing homeland. They watch as the countryside they love becomes depopulated and Irish farming economically devastated. The new book affords a fierce, realistic picture of Ireland today, one many Irish-Americans, who devoured the couple's last few books like soda bread on March 17, may not wish to hear. But perhaps the pair's popularity--and charm and vibrancy--will serve through this book to draw attention to the real difficulties the rural Irish face. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i></p><h2>The Empress and the Silkworm</h2><p>Almost five thousand years ago, a young Chinese empress was having tea in the garden. A cocoon from a mulberry tree fell into her cup. Through a dream and her persistence, the first silk cloth was made.</p><p>Hong is an Albert Whitman author.Kindergarten-Grade 4?Tradition honors Si Ling-Chi, wife of the legendary "Yellow Emperor," Huang-Ti, who ruled China nearly 5,000 years ago, with the discovery of silk. In Hong's well-paced narrative, the empress is a creative, curious, and determined woman who heeds omens and dreams. When a cocoon falls out of a mulberry tree into her morning tea, she is intrigued by it and unwinds a softened lustrous thread from its core. In a dream, she sees her husband garbed in a "shimmering yellow robe" woven of this thread, and she persues her vision in the face of ridicule by courtiers, eventually creating the first silk cloth. An endnote summarizes what is known about the history of Chinese silk and explains how it is made. The illustrations feature Hong's soft, clear blocks of color and static, doll-like figures, familiar to readers of How the Ox Star Fell from Heaven (1991) and Two of Everything (1993, both Albert Whitman). The gorgeous gowns and buildings suggest China during the Ching Dynasty (A.D.1644-1912). Readers will find this era more recognizably "Chinese" than any pictures attempting to show mythic times.

Euripides&#x2019; plays rarely won first prize in the great democratic competitions of ancient Athens, but their combustible mixture of realism and extremism fascinated audiences throughout the Greek world. In the last days of the Peloponnesian War, Athenian prisoners held captive in far-off Sicily were said to have won their freedom by reciting snatches of Euripides&#x2019; latest tragedies.<br>&nbsp;<br>Four of those tragedies are here presented in new translations by the contemporary poet and classicist Anne Carson. They are <i>Herakles</i>, in which the hero swaggers home to destroy his own family; <i>Hekabe</i>, set after the Trojan War, in which Hektor&#x2019;s widow takes vengeance on her Greek captors; <i>Hippolytos</i>, about love and the horror of love; and the strange tragic-comedy fable <i>Alkestis</i>, which tells of a husband who arranges for his wife to die in his place. The volume also contains brief introductions by Carson to each of the plays along with two remarkable framing essays: &#x201c;Tragedy: A Curious Art Form&#x201d; and &#x201c;Why I Wrote Two Plays About Phaidra.&#x201d;</p><p>"Writing with a pitch and heat that gets to the heart of the unforgiving classical world, Carson, a poet translates four of the 18 surviving plays by Euripides: Alkestis, Herakles, Hekabe and Hippolytos. Worth the price of admission alone is Carson&#x2019;s blistering essay-afterword, written in Euripides&#x2019;s voice, which asks questions like "Is all anger sexual?" This amazing book gets very close to the playwright&#x2019;s enigmatic answers."--Publishers Weekly, starred review<b>Anne Carson</b> is professor of classics and comparative literature at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

With his previous novel, <i>Pattern Recognition</i>, the challenge of writing about the present-day world drove him to create perhaps his best novel yet, and in <i>Spook Country</i> he remains at the top of his game. It's a stripped-down thriller that reads like the best DeLillo (or the best Gibson), with the lives of a half-dozen evocative characters connected by a tightly converging plot and by the general senses of unease and wonder in our networked, post-9/11 time. <p> <strong>Across the Border to <i>Spook Country</i></strong> </p><p>For the last few decades, William Gibson, who grew up in Virginia and elsewhere in the United States, has lived in Vancouver, British Columbia, just across the border from Amazon.com's Seattle headquarters, which made for a short drive for a lunchtime interview before the release of <i>Spook Country</i>. We met just a few miles from where the storylines of the new novel, in a rare scene set in Gibson's own city, converge. You can read the full transcript of the interview, in which we discussed, among other things, writing in the age of Google, visiting the Second Life virtual world, the possibilities of science fiction in an age of rapid change, and his original proposal for <i>Spook Country</i>, which we have available for viewing on our site. Here are a few excerpts from the interview: </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Could you start by telling us a little bit about the scenario of the new book? </p><p><strong>William Gibson:</strong> It's a book in which shadowy and mysterious characters are using New York's smallest crime family, a sort of boutique operation of smugglers and so-called illegal facilitators, to get something into North America. And you have to hang around to the end of the book to find out what they're doing. So I guess it's a caper novel in that regard. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The line on your last book, <i>Pattern Recognition</i> was that the present had caught up with William Gibson's future. So many of the things you imagined have come true that in a way it seems like we're all living in science fiction now. Is that the way you felt when you came to write that book, that the real world had caught up with your ideas? </p><p><strong>Gibson:</strong> Well, I thought that writing about the world today as I perceive it would probably be more challenging, in the real sense of science fiction, than continuing just to make things up. And I found that to absolutely be the case. If I'm going to write fiction set in an imaginary future now, I'm going to need a yardstick that gives me some accurate sense of how weird things are now. 'Cause I'm going to have to go beyond that. And I think over the course of these last two books--I don't think I'm done yet--I've been getting a yardstick together. But I don't know if I'll be able to do it again. I don't know if I'll be able to make up an imaginary future in the same way. In the '80s and '90s--as strange as it may seem to say this--we had such luxury of stability. Things weren't changing quite so quickly in the '80s and '90s. And when things are changing too quickly, as one of the characters in <i>Pattern Recognition</i> says, you don't have any place to stand from which to imagine a very elaborate future. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Now that you're writing about the present, do you consider yourself a science fiction writer these days? Because the marketplace still does. </p><p><strong>Gibson:</strong> I never really believed in the separation. But science fiction is definitely where I'm from. Science fiction is my native literary culture. It's what I started reading, and I think the thing that actually makes me a bit different than some of the science fiction writers I've met who are my own age is that I discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs and William Burroughs in the same week. And I started reading Beat poets a year later, and got that in the mix. That really changed the direction. But it seems like such an old-fashioned way of looking at things. And it's better not to be pinned down. It's a matter of where you're allowed to park. If you can park in the science fiction bookstore, that's good. If you can park in the other bookstore, that's really good. If people come and buy it at Amazon, that's really good. </p><p>I'm sure I must have readers from 20 years ago who are just despairing of the absence of cyberstuff, or girls with bionic fingernails. But that just the way it is. All of that stuff reads so differently now. I think nothing dates more quickly than science fiction. Nothing dates more quickly than an imaginary future. It's acquiring a patina of quaintness even before you've got it in the envelope to send to the publisher. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> So do you think that's your own career path, that you're less interested in imagining a future, or do you think that the world is changing? </p><p><strong>Gibson:</strong> I think it's actually both. Until fairly recently, I had assumed that it was me, me being drawn to use this toolkit I'd acquired when I was a teenager, and using my old SF toolkit in some kind of attempt at naturalism, 21st-century naturalistic fiction. But over the last five to six years it's started to seem to me that there's something else going on as well, that maybe we're in what the characters in my novel <i>Idoru</i> call a "nodal point," or a series of them. We're in a place where things could just go anywhere. A couple of weeks ago I happened to read Charlie Stross's argument as to why he believes that there will never, ever be any manned space travel. It's not going to happen. We're not going to colonize Mars. All of that is just a big fantasy. And it's so convincing. I read that and I'm like, "My god, there goes so much of the fiction I read as a child." </p><b>William Gibson</b>&#x2019;s first novel, <i>Neuromancer</i>, won the Hugo Award, the Philip K.

He revealed the truth about himself, about the Father in heaven, about the world, sin, eternal life and what it means to live an abundant life. And your closest friends are the ones who will tell you the truth about yourself. Jesus is that kind of friend. He reveals your identity, makes sense of your history, exposes your needs and points you toward your destiny. When we meet Jesus the revealer, we discover truth--and ourselves. The Jesus 101 Series engages both mind and heart. The sessions bring a fresh perspective on who Jesus is, how he interacted with people in Scripture and how he relates to us. The discussion questions are designed particularly to help a group to learn from each other but also provide an interesting context for individual reflection. As you discover the ways Jesus fulfills our lives, you may fall in love with him again--or for the first time.</p><p>Bill Donahue (Ph.D., University of North Texas) is founder and lead strategist for The Communitas Network, which coaches and equips catalytic leaders to build transformational teams for the purpose of mobilizing missional communities.

What he ended up with instead was <em>The Ocean at the of the Lane</em>--his first adult novel since <em>Anansi Boys</em> came out in 2005, and a narrative so thoughtful and thrilling that it's as difficult to stop reading as it was for Gaiman to stop writing. Forty years ago, our narrator, who was then a seven-year-old boy, unwittingly discovered a neighboring family&#x2019;s supernatural secret. What happens next is an imaginative romp through otherwordly adventure that could only come from Gaiman's magical mind. Childhood innocence is tested and transcended as we see what getting between ancient, mystic forces can cost, as well as what can be gained from the power of true friendship. The result is a captivating tale that is equal parts sweet, sad, and spooky. <em>--Robin A. Rothman</em><p></p><p>A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home and is drawn to the farm at the end of the road where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl and her mother and grandmother. As he sits by the pond �behind the ramshackle old house, the unremembered past comes flooding back&#x2014;a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.</p><p>A groundbreaking work as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark, <em>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</em> is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out.</p></p><h2>Christmas in Plains: Memories</h2><p>In a beautifully rendered portrait, Jimmy Carter remembers the Christmas days of his Plains boyhood -- the simplicity of family and community gift-giving, his father&#39;s eggnog, the children&#39;s house decorations, the school Nativity pageant, the fireworks, Luke&#39;s story of the birth of Christ, and the poignancy of his black neighbors&#39; poverty. Later, away at Annapolis, he always went home to Plains, and during his Navy years, when he and Rosalynn were raising their young family, they spent their Christmases together re-creating for their children the holiday festivities of their youth. Since the Carters returned home to Plains for good, they have always been there on Christmas Day, with only one exception in forty-eight years: In 1980, with Americans held hostage in Iran, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and Amy went by themselves to Camp David, where they felt lonely. Amy suggested that they invite the White House staff and their families to join them and to celebrate. Nowadays the Carters&#39; large family is still together at Christmastime, offering each other the gifts and the lifelong rituals that mark this day for them. With the novelist&#39;s eye that enchanted readers of his memoir An Hour Before Daylight, Jimmy Carter has written another American classic, in the tradition of Truman Capote&#39;s A Christmas Memory and Dylan Thomas&#39;s A Child&#39;s Christmas in Wales.</p><p>Jimmy Carter's Georgia hometown has been the one constant in his life, and he pays tribute to it with <i>Christmas in Plains</i>, a collection of holiday memories from his childhood through his Navy days, his time as Georgia governor and U.S. president, and his very active retirement. As a schoolboy, Carter looked forward to painting many-colored magnolia leaves to mix in with the holly on the mantle. His favorite way to collect mistletoe "usually at the top of oak or pecan trees and on the ends of slender limbs, was to shoot into the clump and let the bullets or buckshot cut off some sprigs." And when his godmother went to Cleveland, Ohio, one December, he asked her to bring back a snowball. It was quite some time before he realized that the large white marble she gave him was not "a real petrified snowball." Carter's memories of holding onto faith during the Christmases of his presidency are often poignant, taking place in the context of the Iranian hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. And his postretirement experiences of Christmas are strangely, comfortingly familiar, characterized by jealousy of in-laws and generosity towards neighbors. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Jimmy Carter</b> was born in Plains, Georgia, and served as thirty-ninth President of the United States.

Fearful of a repeat on the one hundredth anniversary of the nightmarish contagion, Jack autopsies the woman within hours of her demise and discovers some striking anomalies: first, that she has had a heart transplant, and second, that, against all odds, her DNA matches that of the transplanted heart. <br><br>Although the facts don't add up to influenza, Jack must race against the clock to identify the woman and determine what kind of virus could wreak such havoc--a task made more urgent when two other victims succumb to a similar rapid death. But nothing makes sense until his investigation leads him into the fascinating realm of CRISPR/CAS9, a gene-editing biotechnology that's captured the imagination of the medical community. . . and the attention of its most unethical members. Drawn into the dark underbelly of the organ transplant market, Jack will come face-to-face with a megalomaniacal businessman willing to risk human lives in order to conquer a lucrative new frontier in medicine--and if Jack's not careful, the next life lost might be his own.</p><p><b>Robin Cook, MD,</b>&nbsp;is the author of more than 30 books and is credited with popularizing the medical thriller with his groundbreaking and wildly successful 1977 novel,&nbsp;<i>Coma</i>. He divides his time among Florida, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.<p>1</p><p></p><p>Later that morning . . .</p><p></p><p>Monday, November 5, 10:30 a.m.</p><p></p><p>By 10:30 in the morning all eight autopsy tables at New York City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, known colloquially as the OCME, were in use, as the team tried to catch up with demand. Over the weekend there had been a backup of ten bodies that had not been considered forensic emergencies and had been left for Monday morning. Besides those ten, six new cases had come in between late Sunday afternoon and early that morning. Table #1, the table farthest from the stainless-steel sinks, had seen the most action. This was the table favored by Dr. Jack Stapleton. Since he was almost always the first doctor in the "pit" in the morning, he got to choose his station, and he always told Vinnie Ammendola, the mortuary tech with whom he usually teamed, to nab it. Situated at the periphery, it was a little bit separate from the main commotion in the autopsy room when all the tables were in use. At that time Jack was already starting his third case. Most of the other tables were still on their first.</p><p></p><p>"So!" Jack said, straightening up. He had just carefully shaved away the blood-soaked, matted hair from the right side of the victim's head. He had been very careful not to distort the wound he wished to expose. What was now obvious was a completely circular dark-red-to-black lesion an inch or two above the woman's right ear, surrounded by a narrow circular abrasion. The patient was on her back, with her head rotated to the left and propped up on a wooden block. She was naked and so pale she could have been mistaken for a wax-museum model.</p><p></p><p>"Is the entrance wound round or oval?" Jack liked a didactic style and frequently used it even when other people weren't listening, as often happened when he was working with Vinnie. Vinnie had a habit of zoning out on occasion. But this morning Jack had an attentive audience. Lieutenant Detective Lou Soldano, an old friend of Jack and Jack's wife, Laurie, had shown up. Over the years Lou had come to truly appreciate the enormous benefits forensic pathology could provide to law enforcement, particularly when it came to homicide investigation, which was his specialty. Whenever there was a case that Lou thought could be helped by forensics, he made it a point to observe the autopsy. Although there hadn't been any such cases for a number of months, that morning there had been three.</p><p></p><p>"I'd say circular," Lou said. Lou was standing across from Jack on the patient's left side. Also on that side was Vinnie. Next to Jack was a second mortuary tech, Carlos Sanchez, who had been newly hired by the OCME and was now at the very beginning of his orientation and training. As one of the more experienced techs, Vinnie generally broke in newbies by having them work closely with him. Jack was accustomed to the routine and usually didn't mind, provided it didn't slow him down too much. Jack was one of those people who didn't like to waste time and had little patience for incompetence. So far, he wasn't all that impressed with Carlos. It wasn't anything specific, more an attitude thing, as if the man wasn't all that interested.</p><p></p><p>"I agree," Jack said. "Vinnie?"</p><p></p><p>"Circular," Vinnie said, rolling his eyes. Vinnie and Jack had worked with each other so many times over so many years that they could anticipate each other. Vinnie knew that the tone of voice Jack had used strongly suggested he was about to start a "teaching" session, which invariably meant the autopsy would end up taking considerably longer than otherwise, keeping Vinnie away from the coffee break he always took after the third case was over. Vinnie was a coffee addict and his last cup had been just after seven that morning.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Sanchez?" Jack asked, ignoring Vinnie's mild acting out.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Carlos blurted.</p><p></p><p>Jack turned to look into the eyes of the new hire, just visible through the man's plastic face shield. "Are we keeping you from some other, more interesting engagement, Mr. Sanchez?" he asked sarcastically, but then let it go. He turned back to Lou. "It is definitely circular, meaning the bullet entered perpendicular to the plane of the skull. More apropos, it is certainly not what is described as stellate or jagged. Now, do you see any stippling around the periphery of the wound?" The little red dots in the skin that sometimes surrounded gunshot wounds resulted from gunpowder residue emerging from a gun barrel along with the bullet.</p><p></p><p>"I don't see that much except on the ear," Lou said, trying to be optimistic.</p><p></p><p>"There is a bit on the ear and also some on the neck," Jack said, pointing. "Obviously the full head of hair absorbed most of it."</p><p></p><p>"I don't think I'm going to like where you're going with all this," Lou said. The victim was the wife of one of Lou's detective colleagues who also worked out of the NYPD's Homicide Division.</p><p></p><p>Jack nodded. There was no doubt that Lou had become quite forensically knowledgeable over the years of their friendship. "There's more. Let's use a wooden dowel to align this entrance wound above the right ear with the exit wound below the left mandible."</p><p></p><p>Vinnie handed Jack the wooden rod he had leaned against the autopsy table. Grasping it at both ends, Jack held it so that it rested on the crown of the patient's head but lined up with the two wounds.</p><p></p><p>Lou reluctantly agreed. "I'm getting the picture: The pathway of the bullet is definitely downward."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news," Jack offered, hearing the disappointment in his friend's voice. "Unfortunately, what we see here is not a contact wound. My guess at this point would be that the gun barrel had to have been about two feet away and maybe as much as thirty inches. And the trajectory was definitely oriented caudally. Are you aware of the statistics about this?"</p><p></p><p>"Not exactly," Lou said. "But I know it's not what I was hoping. Jesus, I've known this guy for more than twenty years. I've even had dinner in their home out in Queens a dozen times, especially after I got divorced. They had their problems, like all couples. But hell! They have two grown kids."</p><p></p><p>"Ninety percent or more of small-arms suicides are contact wounds, meaning the barrel of the gun is up against the skull when discharged. In only about five percent of suicides is the bullet path downward, and an even smaller percentage where it's directed from the back to the front, both of which we see here."</p><p></p><p>"So you don't think this was a suicide?" Lou asked, almost plaintively.</p><p></p><p>Jack shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Can we get on with this freakin' autopsy," Vinnie complained.</p><p></p><p>Jack flashed a dirty look at his favorite mortuary tech. Vinnie ignored it. "I'm having caffeine withdrawal."</p><p></p><p>"Was there a suicide note?" Jack asked, returning his attention to Lou.</p><p></p><p>"Clutched in her left hand," Lou said with a nod. "One of Walter's service automatics was in her right hand. She was lying on their bed on her back. It was a mess."</p><p></p><p>"And he had called you?" Jack said.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah," Lou said. "We'd been together most of the evening after being called out on that first autopsy we did. Walter found her dead when he got home, or so he said. I was the one who put in the nine-one-one call as I was leaving my apartment on my way over to see him. I got there before anyone else, and the man was beside himself. It was godawful. Not that I haven't seen worse."</p><p></p><p>"Well, we'll have to see how it plays out," Jack said. "Maybe there was a third party involved. But I certainly will not be signing this out as a suicide. I'm definitely thinking homicide. But let's do the autopsy and go from there."</p><p></p><p>"Hallelujah," Vinnie said, making a rapid sign of the cross in the air in appreciation.</p><p></p><p>"Let's not be blasphemous," Jack chided sardonically.</p><p></p><p>"You should talk," Vinnie scoffed. More than anyone at the OCME, Vinnie knew just how irreverent Jack Stapleton could be. Jack was not a religious man after his first wife and two young daughters had been killed in a commuter plane crash. He couldn't imagine a Christian God would let such a terrible thing happen.</p><p></p><p>The postmortem went quickly. Other than a number of uterine fibroids, the woman's general health had been excellent and there was no pathology. The part of the autopsy that took the longest came after Vinnie had shown Carlos how to remove the skull cap. With appropriate exposure, Jack had carefully followed the bullet's transit through the brain, where it had wreaked complete havoc. While Jack was busy, Vinnie exposed the underside of the skull cap to photograph the beveled edges of the inner aspect of the entrance wound.</p><p></p><p>When Jack's third autopsy was complete, he left Vinnie and Carlos to clean up and return the cadaver to the walk-in cooler. Although Lou usually departed as soon as the main part of the autopsy was over, on this occasion he stayed until the bitter end. Jack sensed he was reluctant to head back to his lonely apartment in SoHo. The implication was that he needed to talk more about the disturbing autopsy results, even though he was plainly exhausted from having been up all night.</p><p></p><p>After changing out of their autopsy gear, Jack took Lou up to the so-called lunchroom on the second floor, which wasn't much with its blue-painted concrete-block walls, cheap molded-plastic furniture, and handful of vending machines. For a modern medical examiner's office with a staff of highly trained, world-class forensic pathologists, it was pathetic. But there was a light at the end of the tunnel. A brand-new high-rise NYC medical examiner's building had been constructed on 26th Street, four blocks south of the sad, existing six-story structure that had been built almost a century ago at 30th Street and First Avenue. Most of the Manhattan office's hundreds of employees had already moved to the palatial new location. Those who had yet to go were the toxicologists and the entire bevy of MEs. The problem was that the new building did not have an autopsy room. A new state-of-the-art autopsy facility was still in the planning stages, to be built as a separate structure next to the new high-rise. Until it was operational, Jack and his colleagues had to remain in the old, outdated structure.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing the choices, what can I get you?" Jack asked. He regarded his friend of almost twenty years. As his name clearly suggested, Lou was distinctly southern Italian, with thick, reasonably long, mostly dark hair and equally dark eyes and decidedly olive skin. A handsome, heavy-featured man of medium height and musculature, with a girth that suggested too much pasta and not enough exercise. As usual, he was wearing a dark blue suit that didn't appear to have been pressed in the previous year. His rumpled white dress shirt was open at the collar and his gravy-stained silk tie was loosened and appeared never to have been untied, but rather slipped over the head at the end of each and every day.</p><p></p><p>The comparison with Jack was stark, especially when the two were standing right next to each other as they were now. Jack's hair was a light brown, cut moderately short, with a blush of gray over his temples. His eyes were the color of maple syrup and his complexion suggested he had a slight tan even when he hadn't been in the sun for months. At six feet two inches tall, with an athletic build from bike riding and street basketball, he seemed to tower over Lou, whose habit was to hunch over as if his head were far too heavy.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Lou admitted. He was having trouble making up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"How about a water," Jack suggested. He knew the last thing Lou needed was more coffee. What he really needed was sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, water's fine," Lou said.</p><p></p><p>Jack got two waters and sat down across from Lou.</p><p></p><p>"You'll let me know what toxicology shows on the second case," Lou said.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely," Jack said. "As soon as I know." All three cases that Lou had come in to watch that morning involved the NYC Police Department. The one Lou was currently referring to was a "death in custody" case. During the autopsy Jack had been able to show Lou that the prisoner's hyoid bone had been fractured, which was a clear demonstration that a lethal choke hold had been used. It had happened during an arrest. The question now was whether the force was justified or whether it was excessive. The neighborhood where it had happened was up in arms and wanted answers.</p><p></p><p>Lou was also awaiting final word on the first case he had watched Jack handle that morning. It, too, was an arrest that had gone bad, resulting in a shootout with the victim holed up in his car, where he was hit four times. Several bystanders claimed that the victim had yelled "enough" and had stopped firing, yet still the police shot him. Once again it was a potential PR nightmare for the police department, and a tragedy if it proved to be true. To get answers, Jack had painstakingly tracked all four bullets in the man's body and now wanted to re-create the scene in the special laboratory in the new high-rise building to figure out exactly what had happened and when.</p><p></p><p>"It's been an interesting morning," Jack said. "I'm especially sorry that I couldn't be more help for your buddy. Probably the case is going to turn on the suicide note and whether it's authentic. Divorce isn't fun, but it is a lot better than homicide, if that's what the case turns out to be."</p><p></p><p>"Enough about me and my problems," Lou said with a wave of dismissal. "What's up at the Stapleton-Montgomery household these days? I haven't talked to you or Laur for ages." Lou had met Laurie Montgomery, Jack's wife, before Jack had been hired by the NYC OCME. Lou and Laurie had even briefly dated until they both sensed it wasn't to be and became fast friends instead. When Jack came on the scene, Lou had been his advocate. Laur had been the name one of Lou's daughters had used when she'd first met Laurie, and, thinking it cute, Lou had adopted it as well.</p><p></p><p>"Please," Jack said. "Let's not go there."</p><p></p><p>"Uh-oh." Lou leaned forward over the table. "Knowing you as I do, I don't like the sound of this. What's up?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if I want to get into it," Jack told him.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't talk to me, who are you going to talk to?" Lou arched a brow. "I love both you guys."</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Understanding Jewish History (1)</h2><p>Records the many stories of the journey of the Jewish people through history</p><p>Grade 7 Up. This survey of Jewish history from the emergence of the first Hebrews, perhaps 4000 years ago (2,000 B.C.E.) to their expulsion from Ferdinand and Isabella's Spain in 1492, encompasses much geography and highly diverse religious and cultural experiences. The author writes as a practicing Jew. His perspective is traditional when dealing with events that some may consider legendary, mythical, or folkloric. Yet, he is not didactic. He allows that chronology may be inexact and uses phrases such as "according to the Bible," "the Bible relates," "the Bible tells how," and "according to tradition." Both text and highlighted time-line sections place Jewish history within the framework of broader world events. The full-color illustrations add information and are superb in quality. They include reproductions of paintings, sculpture, mosaics, inscriptions, engravings, coins, and photographs of archaeological sites. This comprehensive volume represents an impressive achievement. Scharfstein's respect for the intelligence of his audience and for his subject elevate this book above most surveys of religion.?Libby K. White, Schenectady County Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6^-9. The title implies a textbook sound, and in some ways that is not so far from the truth. The book is a straightforward history, beginning in biblical times and ending with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in the fifteenth century. But unlike some textbooks, this is handsomely illustrated with photos, maps, and reproductions on almost every page. Libraries needing an attractive, inclusive, and easily digestible history of the Jewish people will find that this will suit their needs. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>A People and a Nation (HS EDITION)</h2><p>Like new book with book corners slightly worn.

Juliet, a maid-in-waiting to a medieval lady, risks her life to get a message to a woman whose husband has been unjustly imprisoned. Both tales have happy endings. While the stories are engaging and filled with interesting period details further described in the afterwords, the plot lines are thin and only the protagonists are well-developed characters. Indeed, the books seem to be somewhat more of an excuse for peddling the Girlhood Dolls advertised on the last page than an attempt to provide young readers with solid stories. The words "mystery" and "rescue" in the subtitles promise more excitement and suspense than the tales actually deliver, especially in the case of Marie. Full-color illustrations appear throughout both titles; the pictures in Marie are rather stilted.

Indeed, logic goes to the very core of what we mean by human intelligence. In this concise, crisply readable book, distinguished professor D. Q. McInerny offers an indispensable guide to using logic to advantage in everyday life. Written explicitly for the layperson, McInerny&#x2019;s <i>Being Logical</i> promises to take its place beside Strunk and White&#x2019;s <i>The Elements of Style</i> as a classic of lucid, invaluable advice. <br><br>As McInerny notes, logic is a deep, wide, and wonderfully varied field, with a bearing on every aspect of our intellectual life. A mastery of logic begins with an understanding of right reasoning&#x2013;and encompasses a grasp of the close kinship between logical thought and logical expression, a knowledge of the basic terms of argument, and a familiarity with the pitfalls of illogical thinking. Accordingly, McInerny structures his book in a series of brief, penetrating chapters that build on one another to form a unified and coherent introduction to clear and effective reasoning.<br><br>At the heart of the book is a brilliant consideration of argument&#x2013;how an argument is founded and elaborated, how it differs from other forms of intellectual discourse, and how it critically embodies the elements of logic. McInerny teases out the subtleties and complexities of premises and conclusions, differentiates statements of fact from statements of value, and discusses the principles and uses of every major type of argument, from the syllogistic to the conditional. In addition, he provides an incisive look at illogical thinking and explains how to recognize and avoid the most common errors of logic.<br><br>Elegant, pithy, and precise, <i>Being Logical</i> breaks logic down to its essentials through clear analysis, accessible examples, and focused insights. Whether you are a student or a teacher, a professional sharpening your career skills or an amateur devoted to the fine points of thought and expression, you are sure to find this brief guide to effecting reasoning both fascinating and illuminating.</p><p><b>D. Q. MCINERNY</b> has taught logic to college students for decades at Notre Dame, the University of Kentucky, and Our Lady of Guadalupe Seminary in Lincoln, Nebraska.

It also presupposes our having a healthy respect for the firm factualness of the world in which we live, for logic is about reality. Finally, being logical presupposes a lively awareness of how the facts that are our ideas relate to the facts that are the objects in the world, for logic is about truth. In this first part of the book I will discuss those attitudes, points of view, and practical procedures whose adoption prepares the mind for a successful engagement with logic.<br><br>1. Be Attentive<br><br>Many mistakes in reasoning are explained by the fact that we are not paying sufficient attention to the situation in which we find ourselves. This is especially true in familiar situations. That very familiarity causes us to make careless judgments about facts right before our eyes. We misread a situation because we are skimming it, when what we should be doing is perusing it. Often, we assume that a familiar situation will be but a repeat performance of a similar situation we&#x2019;ve experienced before. But, in the strictest sense, there are no repeat performances. Every situation is unique, and we must be alert to its uniqueness.<br><br>The phrase &#x201c;to pay attention&#x201d; is telling. It reminds us that attention costs something. Attention demands an active, energetic response to every situation, to the persons, places, and things that make up the situation. It is impossible to be truly attentive and passive at the same time. Don&#x2019;t just look, see. Don&#x2019;t just hear, listen. Train yourself to focus on details. The little things are not to be ignored, for it is just the little things that lead us to the big things.<br><br>2. Get the Facts Straight<br><br>A fact is something made or done. It has clear objective status. It is something we respond to as having an independent status all its own. It is naggingly persistent, demands recognition, and can be nasty if ignored.<br><br>There are two basic types of objective facts, things and events. A &#x201c;thing&#x201d; is an actually existing entity, animal, vegetable, or mineral. The White House is an example of the first type of fact, and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln of the second. The first type is more basic than the second because events are made up of things or of the actions of things. A state dinner is to be held at the White House. Such an event could not take place were it not for the existence, first and foremost, of the fact that is the White House, and countless other facts as well. In order to establish the factualness of an event, any number of concrete things need to be appealed to.<br><br>To determine the reality of a fact that is a thing, all you need do is pay it a visit. If it actually exists it must be somewhere, and, assuming its place to be accessible to you,<br><br>you can verify its factualness by direct observation. Take the case of the White House. To ascertain its being a fact, rather than purely imaginary, you can travel to Washington, D.C., and there see the White House with your own eyes. That is the most direct and reliable way to establish its factualness. But you could also rely on indirect evidence: For example, by taking the word of a trustworthy eyewitness that the White House is indeed in Washington, D.C. Or you could decide that photographic evidence is sufficient to establish factualness.<br><br>But what about an event like Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination? We say that is a fact. What is the justification for that claim? It is an event that is over and done with, and there are no living witnesses to the event whom we might consult. Obviously, we did not ourselves witness the event, so direct evidence is out of the question. In this case our approach will be to acquaint ourselves with a variety of things that serve as indirect evidence of the event. For example, we would consult official documents (police reports, the death certificate, etc.), newspaper accounts, photographs, memoirs, diaries, and items in the Congressional Record, all of which are facts in their own right and whose only reasonable explanation is the factualness of Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination. On the basis of the factualness of these things, we establish the factualness of the event. And we thus establish a historical fact.<br><br>Facts can also be thought of as objective or subjective. Both things and events are objective facts. They exist in the public domain and are in principle accessible to all. A subjective fact is one that is limited to the subject experiencing it. A headache would be an example of a subjective fact. If I am the one experiencing the headache, then I have direct evidence of its factualness. But if it is you experiencing the headache, I can establish its factualness only indirectly. I must take your word that you have a headache. Establishing the reality of subjective facts depends entirely on the trustworthiness of those who claim to be experiencing them.<br><br>To sum up how we get the facts straight: If a given fact is an actually existing thing to which we have access, then the surest way to establish its factualness is to put ourselves in its presence. We then have direct evidence of it. If we cannot establish factualness by direct evidence, we must rigorously test the authenticity and reliability of whatever indirect evidence we rely upon so that, on the basis of that evidence, we can confidently establish the factualness of the thing.<br><br>There are only a very limited number of significant public events which we can experience directly. This means that, in almost every case, we must rely on indirect evidence. In establishing the factualness of events by indirect evidence, we must exercise the same kind of care we do in establishing the factualness of &#x201c;things&#x201d; by indirect evidence. It all comes down to the authenticity and reliability of our sources.<br><br>A subjective fact, to the subject experiencing it, is self-evident under normal circumstance. However, through such mechanisms as self-delusion or rationalization, a person could fail to get straight a fact even about himself.<br><br>Because the establishment of the factualness of a subjective fact pertaining to another person depends entirely on the trustworthiness of that person, you must first, insofar as it is possible, establish the trustworthiness of the person in question.<br><br>3. Ideas and the Objects of Ideas<br><br>Every idea in the mind is ultimately traceable to a thing, or things, actually existing in a world that is independent of and apart from the mind. An idea is the subjective evocation of an objective fact. Clear ideas, then, are ideas that faithfully reflect the objective order from which they derive. Unclear ideas, conversely, are those that give us a distorted representation of the objective world.<br><br>Though the control we have over our ideas is not absolute, it is real. This means that we are not helpless in the face of unclear ideas. To ensure that our ideas are clear, we must vigilantly attend to the relationship between any given idea and its object. If it is a strained relationship, if the connection between the idea and its object is tenuous, then we are dealing with an unclear idea.<br><br>It is wrong to suppose that because we know things in the world only through our ideas, it is only our ideas which we really know. Our ideas are the means, not the ends, of our knowledge. They link us to the world. If they are clear ideas, the links are strong. The most efficient way to clarify our ideas is to look through them to the objects they represent.<br><br>4. Be Mindful of the Origins of Ideas<br><br>We all tend to favor our own ideas, which is natural enough. They are, after all, in a sense our very own babies, the conceptions of our minds. But conception is possible in the thinking subject only because of the subject&#x2019;s encounter with the world. Our ideas owe their existence, ultimately, to things outside and independent of the mind, to which they refer: objective facts.<br><br>Our ideas are clear, and our understanding of them is clear, only to the extent that we keep constant tabs on the things to which they refer. The focus must always be on the originating sources of our ideas in the objective world. We do not really understand our own ideas if we suppose them to be self-generating, that is, not owing their existence to extramental realities.<br><br>The more we focus on our ideas in a way that systematically ignores their objective origins, the more unreliable those ideas become. The healthy bonds that bind together the subjective and objective orders are put under great strain, and if we push the process too far, the bonds may break. Then we have effectively divorced ourselves from the objective world. Instead of seeing the world as it is, we see a projected world, one that is not presented to our minds but which is the product of our minds.<br><br>When we speak of &#x201c;establishing a fact,&#x201d; we do not refer to establishing the existence of an idea in the mind. The idea in the mind, as we have seen, is a subjective fact, but the kind of fact we are concerned with establishing is an objective fact. To do so, we must look beyond our ideas to their sources in the objective world. I establish a fact if I successfully ascertain that there is, for a particular idea I have in mind, a corresponding reality external to my mind. For instance, I have a particular idea in my mind, which I label &#x201c;cat.&#x201d; Corresponding to that idea are actually existing things in the extramental world called &#x201c;cats.&#x201d; But I could have another idea in my mind, which I label &#x201c;centaur&#x201d; but for which no corresponding fact can be found in the extramental world. For all that, the idea of &#x201c;centaur&#x201d; is a subjective fact, since it really exists as an idea in my mind.<br><br>5.

The poems include anonymous verse as well as selections from such well-known children's poets as Rosetti and Stevenson. While all of the selections can be found in other collections of poetry for children, the organization and presentation of the poems in this collection gives them new life. The book is arranged in seven sections beginning with "Daybreak" and ending with "Sweet Dreams." The poems are displayed with reproductions of 50 full-color paintings and numerous small engravings. Vivid half-page paintings set off each of the seven sections. While it has been cataloged as a book of children's poetry, librarians will want to consider making this accessible to all ages and to those particularly interested in 19th-Century life and art. Children who enjoy Burnett's The Secret Garden or Alcott's Little Women might like to add life to these novels by reading poems and looking at pictures of children of this period. Barbara Chatton, College of Education, University of Wyoming, Laramie<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.This lavishly illustrated collection of 19th and early 20th century poems is extraordinarily beautiful. Gathered here are poems of such beloved authors as Tennyson, Kipling, Dickinson and Stevenson, loosely organized into categories that follow a child's activities from "Daybreak" to "Sweet Dreams." The volume includes old favorites like Rossetti's "The Wind," as well as a plethora of familiar English rhymes. But what makes this volume outstanding are its illustrations: 100 black-and-white engravings and full-color reproductions of splendid paintings that poignantly evoke the age they represent. Many of the works come from private collections never seen by the general public, and their selection gives the book a stunning freshness and design. In the tradition of the best art books, this volume will be treasured for years to come by children and adults alike.

One of the giants of the twentieth century, Marcel Duchamp changed the course of modern art. Visual arts, music, dance, performance--nothing was ever the same again because he had shifted art's focus from the retinal to the mental. Duchamp sidestepped the banal and sentimental to find the relationship between symbol and object and to unearth the concepts underlying art itself. The author's intimacy with the subject and glorious prose style, wit, and deep sense of irony--"the only antidote to despair"--make him the perfect writer to bring this stunning life story to intelligent readers everywhere.<br></p><p>Marcel Duchamp, born into an artistic middle-class French family in 1887, first gained recognition as an artist in 1913 when he submitted his painting <i>Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2</i> to the Armory Show in New York. The newspapers latched onto it after discovering that there was no trace of a nude, or even a real figure, in the painting, which came to symbolize the movement of modern art toward absurdity, humor, and avant-garde disregard for expectations. As an artist, Duchamp never matched the success and recognition of his most well-known work; later in his career, his works of "art" consisted of signed ceramic urinals. Calvin Tomkins, a writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> who befriended Duchamp in New York in the 1960s, has written the first full-length biography of the enigmatic Dadaist.Described by Jay Jacobs in Arts Magazine as "one of the best writers on any subject,"<b> Calvin Tomkins</b> has been a New Yorker writer for thirty-five years and author of ten books including the bestselling Living Well is the Best Revenge.

Both believed that the carnage of World War I would be followed by a brave new world based on "the industrial, mechanical, scientific spirit." <p> As editor of a short-lived magazine, the painter, Am�d�e Ozenfant, had written about cubism as a form of "purism" that removed art's extraneous baggage. Idealistic Swiss architect Charles-�douard Jeanneret (a.k.a. Le Corbusier) had returned from travels through Europe and the Mediterranean convinced that the best buildings were based on modular geometric forms.</p><p> Together, the two developed an aesthetic based on what they saw as the overwhelming human need for order and the "remarkable refinement and purity" of machines. Both men painted distinctively geometric and architectural still lifes, in which bottles, vases, or even a pile of plates took on the forms of Greek columns. Joined by Fernand L�ger, whose paintings included geometric human figures, more obvious references to machinery, and a brighter palette, the Purists presented their vision at the 1925 International Exposition in Paris.</p><p> The most intriguing chapter in this otherwise straightforward art history book is Tag Gronberg's essay on how the Esprit Nouveau pavilion at the exposition offered a "masculine" counterpart to the feminized postwar image of Paris. While the fashion and beauty industries evoked "a modern consumer culture defined in terms of mobility and constant change," the Purists celebrated "the engineer's aesthetic" and praised the standardized design of men's clothing.</p><p> This modestly sized, elegantly designed volume--which reproduces a good number of the paintings in color, though in a small scale that doesn't do full justice to their eccentric beauty--accompanies an exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (through August 5, 2001). <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>Carol S.

The thirty-seven-year-old skipper, nicknamed &#x201c;Burly,&#x201d; felt anxious this warm Thursday morning. The last fourteen years, ten months, and twenty-eight days of his career had led to this moment. A Kentucky native with a thirst for bourbon, Burlingame had served on six submarines, the last three as the skipper. He had run countless drills, ordered crash dives, and fired practice torpedoes on maneuvers in waters from Connecticut to China. He had even survived a collision with a destroyer in an exercise off Corregidor that had sheared off the top of his periscope barrel, the jagged remnant now an ashtray in which he tapped out the burnt tobacco from his corncob pipe. But today was different. Much different.<br> <br>Today he went to war.<br> <br>The Silversides buzzed with anticipation. Lookouts perched atop the periscope shears, scanning the horizon with binoculars. Down in the maneuvering room, sailors tugged levers to control the submarine&#x2019;s various speeds. Cooks in the galley and stewards in the wardroom brewed coffee by the gallon for the seventy officers and crewmembers. More than 3,500 miles of open ocean stood between Burlingame and his destination&#x2014;the empire of Japan. Armed with twenty-four torpedoes and enough frozen meat, canned vegetables, and coffee to last three months, Silversides would take almost two weeks to cover that distance at an average speed of thirteen knots or about fifteen miles per hour. Burlingame planned to use that time to drill his men: a deep dive for trim and tightness, daily surprise dives, and a battle surface drill to test the gun crew. The skipper knew every action mattered.<br> <br>Newspaper headlines captured America&#x2019;s new reality 144 days into the war. The Army belatedly ordered coastal homes, businesses, and high-rises from Maine to Miami to kill nighttime lights that silhouetted offshore supply ships, easy prey for enemy submarines. Two days earlier, the garish billboards and marquees around Times Square advertising such films as Rita Hayworth&#x2019;s My Gal Sal, and a rerelease of Charlie Chaplin&#x2019;s famous The Gold Rush went dark for the first time since a 1917 coal shortage. Draft registration and volunteering now soared&#x2014;more than 1,000 people a minute enrolled at one point&#x2014;as millions queued up outside fire stations, post offices, and schools. The press predicted that some canned goods, coffee, and gasoline would soon be rationed as the war&#x2019;s price tag swelled to a staggering $100 million a day, a figure President Franklin Roosevelt estimated that week in a fireside radio chat would double by year&#x2019;s end.<br> <br>The wreckage of Japan&#x2019;s December 7 surprise attack still littered the cool waters of Pearl Harbor. The burned-out battleship Arizona rested on the muddy bottom with 1,100 sailors entombed inside. The Hawaiian sun reflected off the rusty keels of the capsized battleship Oklahoma and former battleship-turned-target-ship Utah, Burlingame&#x2019;s first ship after he graduated from the Naval Academy. Thousands of divers, welders, and engineers now risked poisonous gas and unexploded ordnance to untangle the destruction. Grim reminders of the tragedy still surfaced. Workers salvaged thousands of waterlogged and rust-stained Christmas cards from one vessel, while marked-out dates on a calendar discovered in a storeroom of the sunken battleship West Virginia revealed that three men had survived until December 23 before oxygen ran out.<br> <br>Japan steamrolled across Asia and the Pacific as America struggled to rebound. The opening lines of Burlingame&#x2019;s secret orders read like a depressing scorecard with the United States and its Allies the clear loser: &#x201c;Japanese forces now control the Philippines, French Indo China, Malaya, part of Burma, Dutch East Indies, part of New Guinea, New Britain, Guam and Wake, in addition to former Japanese territory.&#x201d; But the enemy had made what would prove a fatal misstep in its infamous attack on Pearl Harbor. The bombers and fighters that Sunday morning, in the chaotic fury to destroy America&#x2019;s battlewagons, had failed to target the submarine base, a compound that housed 2,500 officers and crew along with a torpedo plant, machine shops, and repair installations to service the twenty-two Hawaii-based boats, as the subs were often called by those in the service. Likewise, nearby surface tanks filled with 4.5 million barrels of precious fuel oil had miraculously escaped destruction, more than enough fuel to power Silversides and the other submarines that now set off for the empire&#x2019;s waters.<br> <br>Burlingame&#x2019;s mission demanded that he not only target Japan&#x2019;s aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers, but that he also hunt down and destroy all tankers, freighters, and transports that made up the enemy&#x2019;s merchant fleet. The submarine war that American strategists envisioned boiled down to simple economics. Japan&#x2019;s merchant ships&#x2014;many now under the control of its army and navy&#x2014;served as the lifeblood of an empire that stretched across more than twenty million square miles and seven time zones. Merchant ships not only hauled the precious oil, iron ore, and rubber that fed the nation&#x2019;s ravenous war machine but also the soybeans, beef, and sugar that nourished the Japanese people. The outbreak of war had only increased those demands. Merchant ships and transports now ferried troops to the far reaches of the empire along with the bullets, toilet paper, and tooth powder needed to sustain them. If American submarines could destroy Japan&#x2019;s merchant fleet, strategists theorized, the island nation that so hungered for raw materials would starve.<br> <br>The success of this strategy depended on skippers like Burlingame, a man who on first inspection did not appear the most formidable figure. The son of a receiver for the Jefferson County Circuit Court, he stood barely five-feet, eight-inches tall and topped out in college at just 156 pounds. But Burlingame&#x2019;s short stature disguised a rugged toughness that came with being the oldest&#x2014;and smallest&#x2014;of three boys in a home dominated by a stern father who ruled with his hand in the wake of his wife&#x2019;s death in October 1917. The survival instinct and dogged perseverance he honed as the family&#x2019;s &#x201c;runt&#x201d; would prove to be a vital trait, one the future skipper needed just to get into the Navy.<br> <br>The Naval Academy rejected Burlingame in 1922 after his 83.9 percent grade point average from Louisville Male High School fell short of the 85 percent required. Rather than give up, Burlingame applied again, appointed by home state Republican senator Richard Ernst. He took classes at the University of Louisville that fall and crammed for several months with a tutor before he sat for the academy&#x2019;s entrance exam on February 7, 1923&#x2014;and passed. Burlingame&#x2019;s struggle to become a sailor continued after he arrived at Annapolis. This time the issue wasn&#x2019;t grades, but vision after a routine physical his senior year found him colorblind, a critical deficiency in a job that required him to read flags and signals. The Navy debated whether to bounce him from the service or send him into the Supply Corps.<br> <br>Burlingame again rose to battle, petitioning for a retest, which was granted. The Navy issued its report three days later. &#x201c;Upon examination,&#x201d; concluded the report, &#x201c;it is considered that this man has sufficiently acute color perception to warrant his retention in the service.&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite his mediocre academics&#x2014;he graduated 243 out of 580&#x2014;Burlingame would prove a gifted leader. His dislike of the Navy&#x2019;s rigidity made him a natural fit for submarines where starched uniforms gave way at sea to shorts, T-shirts, and sandals. Burlingame spurned the traditional class system that divided officers and enlisted men, preferring his coffee to come from the crew&#x2019;s mess and inviting young sailors to his cabin to share concerns. The only formality required was that enlisted men call officers &#x201c;Mister.&#x201d; Otherwise Burlingame preached that every sailor, from the skipper down to the galley potato peeler, be treated the same. &#x201c;You are not going to start pulling rank,&#x201d; he once commented. &#x201c;You have to live with him. You can&#x2019;t mistreat him, because he might be the guy that turns the right nut or bolt&#x2014;or whatever it is&#x2014;that saves the ship.&#x201d; Burlingame&#x2019;s sense of fair play earned him fierce loyalty from his crew, as evidenced by the observation of one of his pharmacist&#x2019;s mates: &#x201c;There were people on that vessel who would have cut their arm off for that old boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Burlingame wasn&#x2019;t without his quirks and flaws. He shared a prejudice common among his generation toward blacks and Jews, though he never discriminated on board ship. A healthy dose of superstition would prompt the skipper and his crew to install a miniature Buddha statue in the Silversides&#x2019; conning tower and in each torpedo room. A rub of the belly, he boasted, promised good luck during depth charge attacks or when firing torpedoes. Burlingame&#x2019;s greatest weakness was his taste for booze, which on one occasion prompted him to down a bottle of Chanel #5 perfume that he mistook for jitter juice; he joked afterward that he had a hard time keeping the boys at bay. But the skipper never touched liquor at sea other than the so-called medicinal alcohol the Navy provided to calm the nerves after depth charge attacks. To satisfy his craving, Burlingame instead nibbled chocolate. He likewise demanded his men forgo alcohol on board. &#x201c;I drink more than any of you on this ship,&#x201d; Burlingame lectured at the start of each patrol. &#x201c;When I put to sea, I don&#x2019;t drink and when I put to sea with you, you don&#x2019;t drink.&#x201d;<br> <br>Years of hard living had marked the skipper with deep lines etched on his forehead, crow&#x2019;s-feet stamped around his blue eyes, and the gray that peppered the beard he often grew at sea. He looked a decade older than his actual age. Though he had often won past battles, Burlingame privately doubted he would survive the war, a pessimism shared by many and reflected in a letter Lieutenant j.g. Robert Worthington wrote to his mother before departure. &#x201c;Lord knows when we&#x2019;ll see each other again,&#x201d; the Silversides&#x2019; gunnery officer wrote. &#x201c;Maybe never.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Navy Burlingame had fought so hard to join expected him to pursue the enemy with ruthless determination. &#x201c;Press home all attacks. Do not be shaken off,&#x201d; his orders demanded. &#x201c;Make sure that torpedoed vessel sinks.&#x201d; Burlingame and other American submarine skippers over the course of the war would battle enemy destroyers armed with deck guns and depth charges, dodge aerial bomb attacks from the skies, and navigate waters filled with mines. These dangers coupled with torpedo malfunctions, groundings, and operational mishaps would ultimately claim one out of every five American submarines. But Burlingame&#x2019;s anger at the Japanese&#x2014;and a desire to exact revenge&#x2014;overshadowed thoughts of his own death. His anger was common among many servicemen in the wake of Pearl Harbor. &#x201c;We hate those yellow rats something fierce,&#x201d; one of Burlingame&#x2019;s colleagues wrote in a letter to his mother four days after the attack. &#x201c;They will pay plenty.&#x201d;<br> <br>Burlingame planned to make sure.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>The weapon Burlingame skippered through the waves off Pearl Harbor represented decades of evolution in submarine policy and construction. German U-boats surrendered after the Great War had revealed the serious weakness in American submarine designs. The U-boats boasted superb diesel engines that gave them greater cruising ranges along with double hulls that could better withstand depth charges. The German boats sported superior ventilation systems, air compressors, gyroscopes, and enhanced periscope optics and narrow penciled tops that cut down on wakes and made the subs difficult for lookouts to spot. More important to combat submarines, U-boats could dive in just thirty seconds, much faster than American subs and critical for escape.<br> <br>Engineers wrestled with how to overcome the inferiority of American submarine design against the backdrop of numerous peacetime tragedies, ranging from groundings and sinkings to hydrogen explosions and chlorine gas poisonings that by 1927 had claimed the lives of 146 sailors. The loss that December of the submarine S-4 following a collision off Cape Cod galvanized public demands for improved submarine safety. The Navy developed the McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber, a device that could be lowered to a stricken boat and used to ferry sailors to the surface. But experts realized submariners could not always wait on rescue&#x2014;sailors needed to learn to save themselves. The Navy developed rubber rebreathers&#x2014;dubbed the Momsen lung after its inventor, Charles Momsen&#x2014;and constructed escape towers at the submarine school in Connecticut and the Pearl Harbor sub base. Filled with 280,000 gallons of water&#x2014;and with mermaids painted on the walls&#x2014;the towers allowed submariners to practice escape from a stricken submarine at depths of eighteen, fifty, and 100 feet of water, a skill that would prove crucial for a few fortunate sailors during the war with Japan.<br> <br>This safety push coincided with a debate over the strategic role of submarines that would further influence design. Veterans challenged the traditional view that submarines operated best as coastal defenders or as part of larger fleet operations. Relegating submarines to defense failed to maximize the weapon&#x2019;s stealth offensive potential. What other vessel could penetrate enemy harbors and sink ships? Geographic and strategic realities factored into the debate as Americans saw the rise of Japan as a military power and the potential for conflict in the far Pacific. To take the fight to foreign shores, submarines had to be self-sufficient, capable of cruising up to 12,000 miles, and must carry enough food, fuel, and torpedoes to patrol for ninety days. Longer missions demanded better quarters, ventilation, and air-conditioning to keep crews rested and efficient. Through this debate modern fleet boats, like the Silversides, were born.<br> <br>Silversides represented the latest in American submarine technology. Workers at Mare Island Navy Yard near San Francisco had laid the keel of the $6 million Gato class submarine on November 4, 1940. Shipfitters, welders, and electricians labored under the warm California sun for the next 473 days. Eight watertight compartments ran from bow to stern, encapsulated inside a steel hull that could withstand the pressure of depths up to 300 feet, though skippers knew in a pinch the boats could go deeper. More than a dozen fuel and ballast tanks hugged the outside of the pressure hull protected by a second steel skin. A conning tower perched atop with a hatch that led to an exterior bridge, deck, and mounted guns. Once completed, Silversides stretched 312 feet&#x2014;almost the length o...</p><h2>Walt Whitman, A Life</h2><p>A detailed reconstruction of Whitman&#39;s life and times considers the poet&#39;s years of apprenticeship on New York newspapers, his experiences in the Civil War, and his lifetime devotion to the writing and reworking of Leaves of Grass</p><p><p>Justin Kaplan is also the author of <em>Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain</em>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award.

His first book, The Hawk in the Rain, was published in 1957 by Faber &amp; Faber and was followed by many volumes of poetry and prose for adults and children. He received the Whitbread Book of the Year for two consecutive years for his last published collections of poetry, Tales from Ovid and Birthday Letters. He was Poet Laureate from 1984, and in 1998 he was appointed to the Order of Merit.Ted Hughes is familiar to American readers primarily as the husband of poet Sylvia Plath, not as the poet laureate of England. In this first collection of his prose, much of it previously published in various American and British journals, six of the 43 reviews, prefaces and critical essays directly engage Plath's work and life, over which he is known to be protective. He is suspicious of scholars, and the longer pieces, on such traditionally academic subjects as poetic meter and form, are written in his sonorous poet's voice, in prose that recalls T.S. Eliot's restrained irony and force of opinion. Hughes offers learned, unpretentious historical exegeses of Shakespeare, Greek Myth and the genre of Trickster Tales. He reads his fellow poets, such as Dylan Thomas, Emily Dickinson, Eliot and Plath with unfailing sympathy and intelligence, allowing us to glimpse the poets themselves through their work; his evident pleasure in them becomes our own. Scammell, a poet and critic himself, has arranged the volume thematically so that Hughes's incisive, comprehensive take on literature and poetics emerges fully, especially over the multiple readings these essays demand. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>X-Men 1: Gambit - the Complete Collection (Gambit, 1)</h2><p>Gambit plays his cards right and vaults into his own kinetically-charged solo adventures!

He lives in Arnold, Maryland.</p>First Chapter<br>Book One<br>Welcome to Harting Farms<br>(October 1993 January 1994)<br><br>In the fall of 1993, a dark shadow fell over Harting Farms. Newspapers called him the Piper, like the minstrel of Brothers Grimm lore who lured all the children away. There were other darker names, too names kids whispered throughout the halls of Stanton School and carved in the wooden chairs of the library like dirty, fearful secrets. The cafeteria rumbled with talk of escaped mental patients from Sheppard Pratt and lunatic mariners, lustful for child blood, who ported in Baltimore and found their way to our sleepy bayside hamlet.<br>In homeroom, Michael Sugarland drew pictures of werewolves with dripping fangs and claws like bayonets until Mr. Johnson, shaking his head and looking terminally exhausted, told him it was disrespectful of the missing. No one referred to the children as dead because none of them were found not at first, anyway. They were the Missing, the Disappeared. The first few were even thought to be runaways.<br>But all that changed soon enough, and my friends and I were there to see it happen.<br><br>Chapter One<br>Winter Came Early That Year<br><br>We stood at the intersection of Point and Counterpoint Lanes, cigarettes dangling from our mouths like we were serious about something but too cool to show it, and shivered against the wind. Farther up Counterpoint, the rack lights of police cars painted the trees with intermittent red and blue lights.<br>It was early October, but a premature cold spell had overtaken the city, coming in off the Chesapeake and freezing the water around the fishing boats at the docks. The flower stands along the highway had traded in their potted plants and bristling ferns in favor of Indian corn and shiny orange pumpkins. Though it was still too early in the season for snow, the sky looked haunted by it.<br> It had been Peter&#x2019;s idea to skip out after lunch period, and we&#x2019;d gone directly to Solomon&#x2019;s Field to smoke cigarettes and skim rocks across Drunkard&#x2019;s Pond. Neighborhood kids called it that due to the derelicts who drank whiskey beneath the overpass of Solomon&#x2019;s Bend Road. Its actual name was Deaver&#x2019;s Pond, named after a former constable from the 1970s, according to my father, who knew about such things.<br> Peter, Scott, and I watched the conga line of police cars that had sidled up Counterpoint Lane. On the other side of the guardrail, the embankment dropped into the swell of the woods that buffered the street and the vast park below. These woods were known as Satan&#x2019;s Forest, and some people said they were haunted. Most of the trees had already shed their leaves, though what foliage remained burned an almost iridescent orange, as if the tops of these trees were on fire.<br>An ambulance idled on the shoulder, too, its lights off. Twin sawhorses outfitted with flashing orange lights prevented traffic from turning onto Counterpoint Lane. A lone police officer stood behind the sawhorses, gazing at the detouring traffic, a look of abject boredom on his face.<br> We shouldn&#x2019;t hang around,&#x201d; I said. It looks like something important is going on.&#x201d; Which meant my dad might be here, and I didn&#x2019;t want him to catch me loitering on the sidewalk, smoking.<br> Do you think another car went down there?&#x201d; Peter said. He stared at the twisted remains of the guardrail and the deep grooves in the mud made by skidding tires.<br>Two days earlier, a college student named Audrey MacMillan, driving home drunk from Shooter&#x2019;s Galley on Center Street, went off the road, through the guardrail, and down into the woods. She was lucky to have come away with nothing more serious than a broken leg. Before a tow truck could hoist the shattered vehicle out of the woods, the county sent some guys down there to cut away a few of the bigger trees. It had been a fiasco.<br> I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said, but they&#x2019;ve got the road closed for a reason.&#x201d;<br> No chance another car went down,&#x201d; Peter said. I mean, two in one week?&#x201d;<br> I don&#x2019;t see any new skid marks or tire tracks,&#x201d; I said.<br> Check your underwear,&#x201d; Peter said, smirking.<br>He was the oldest by just a few months, though the extra weight he carried afforded him a youthful, almost cherubic look. His pale green eyes were almost always alert, their color and intensity complemented by a shock of unruly red hair he kept too long in the back. He was my best friend since we had unwittingly been dumped together in the same sandbox over in the Palisades all those years ago.<br> The tented black hats of two more uniformed officers materialized on the other side of the guardrail. A fourth officer stepped out from one of the cruisers and leaned against the vehicle&#x2019;s hood, appearing cold even in his fur-lined jacket.<br> Scott nodded in the direction of the police cars. Come on. Let&#x2019;s check it out.&#x201d;<br> They might grab us for truancy,&#x201d; I said. I&#x2019;m already in the doghouse with my dad over that whole Nozzle Neck thing.&#x201d;<br> Mr. Naczalnik, otherwise known as Nozzle Neck due to his faucet-shaped profile and a neck like Ichabod Crane&#x2019;s, was my composition instructor at Stanton School. Last month, I had failed to turn in an assignment, and Nozzle Neck, forever at the ready to make some poor student&#x2019;s life miserable, had wasted no time telephoning my father. I had been grounded for a week.<br> Peter checked his Casio. School&#x2019;s been out for twenty minutes already.&#x201d;<br> In tandem, we crossed the intersection and went up the slight incline of Counterpoint Lane toward the police vehicles and the ambulance.<br> The bored-looking cop approached my friends and me. Sorry, fellas. Street&#x2019;s closed.&#x201d;<br> What happened?&#x201d; Peter asked, trying to peer around the cop.<br> You boys need to get out of the street. You can watch from the other side.&#x201d;<br> Did someone drive off the road again?&#x201d; I asked.<br> No.&#x201d; He was a young cop, almost familiar. I glanced at his nametag but didn&#x2019;t recognize his name. Come on, guys. Shake a leg.&#x201d;<br> It&#x2019;s a free country,&#x201d; Peter said but not with any force. He was still busy trying to look over the cop&#x2019;s shoulder.<br> The cop arched one of his eyebrows. Yeah? Well, you can be as free as you want across the street.&#x201d;<br> Can&#x2019;t we just take a quick peek?&#x201d; Peter pushed.<br> Get your friends back across the street, Angelo.&#x201d;<br> His use of my name didn&#x2019;t surprise me. My father was a detective with the Harting Farms Police Department. Policemen frequently recognized me, even if I hadn&#x2019;t met them before. Come on, guys,&#x201d; I said and stepped onto the sidewalk.<br> Thanks.&#x201d; The police officer nodded at me, then glanced at my friends. You boys are too young to smoke.&#x201d; Then he checked his watch, perhaps recognizing that it was maybe too early for us to be so far from school already, and strutted across the street.<br>There was increasing commotion over there now, although most of it was on the other side of the busted guardrail and farther down the embankment. Two men in white smocks milled about, smoking cigarettes and talking to each other while gazing at their shoes. At one point they spoke briefly with a uniformed officer. Their languid movements and casual air made me think that nothing too urgent was happening on the other side of the guardrail.<br> You know that guy?&#x201d; Scott whispered, even though the cop was too far away to hear him.<br> I shook my head.<br> It&#x2019;s freezing out here.&#x201d; Peter zipped up his coat and blew into his hands. What are they doing, anyway? What&#x2019;s going on over there?&#x201d;<br> I shrugged. For the first time, I was aware of the faint, tinny sounds of Metallica spilling from the headphones Scott had hanging around his neck.<br>Loyal to his surname, Scott Steeple was tall and slender and possessed the coveted body of a natural athlete. His features were subtle, handsome, his eyes introspective and haunted. Having just turned fifteen one month earlier, Scott was the youngest of our group. He should have been in the grade below ours, but his academic prowess had enabled him to skip second grade. Thus, fate had dropped him in the empty desk beside me in Mrs. Brock&#x2019;s third grade class, consequently forging a friendship between us.<br> You guys going to the docks tonight?&#x201d; Peter asked. He was pacing, his hands in his pockets, sometimes pausing to balance on one foot while the other hovered half an inch off the ground.<br> I guess,&#x201d; Scott said.<br> Angie?&#x201d;<br> I don&#x2019;t know, man,&#x201d; I said. What time are you heading over?&#x201d;<br> Maybe around nine.&#x201d;<br> I guess it depends if my dad&#x2019;s home or not. I&#x2019;ve got that new curfew.&#x201d;<br> But it&#x2019;s Friday,&#x201d; Peter said.<br> You know how my dad is.&#x201d; Generally, I was allowed out until eleven o&#x2019;clock on weekends, but since the disappearances, my father had cut my curfew back an hour. If everyone was getting together at nine, it left me precious little time to hang out. I wondered if it would be worth it.<br> Peter frowned. Dude, you gotta come. Sugarland&#x2019;s gonna sink that stupid cow, remember?&#x201d;<br> Yeah, I know.&#x201d;<br> Look,&#x201d; Scott said, taking a single step off the curb. They&#x2019;re coming up.&#x201d;<br> More heads emerged from behind the slope of the embankment, rising like buoys in a gray sea, and I immediately felt both excited and dismayed. The officers leading the pack were the only ones conveying any sense of urgency; they moved quickly ahead of the rest and dispersed along Counterpoint Lane, presumably to make sure no vehicles disobeyed the roadblock. Two of them turned their heads in unison and looked straight at my friends and me. If they were considering shooing us away, these plans were aborted once the full surge of officers, so dense in their numbers that I couldn&#x2019;t count them all without losing my place, joined them.<br>A number of men wore monochromatic suits and thin black neckties. Detectives. Once again, I wondered with some trepidation if my father was among them.<br> What are . . . ?&#x201d; Peter took another step in their direction, but we were still too far away to make out the important details. What are they carrying? You see that, Angie?&#x201d;<br> Yeah,&#x201d; I said. I see it.&#x201d;<br> It was long, white. It was a sheet. It was something wrapped in a sheet. My stomach dropped. I had watched enough TV to know what I was looking at.<br> Oh, goddamn,&#x201d; Peter said, his voice quavering. That&#x2019;s a person.&#x201d;<br> The body was carried on a steel gurney, the gurney&#x2019;s legs retracted, the whole thing covered by a plain white sheet. One of the uniformed officers walked with one hand pressed to the center of the sheet, keeping it from billowing in the wind, even though it was strapped down.<br> A body.<br> They brought the gurney around the opposite side of the ambulance, temporarily disappearing from our view. When they reappeared at the rear of the ambulance, they had rearranged their positions, as if performing an act of prestidigitation.<br>Unable to pry my eyes from the scene, I noticed the officer who had kept his hand pressed to the center of the sheet was no longer there. And as if my observation directly invoked the ire of fate, an icy slipstream of wind barreled across the escarpment, rattling the trees like party favors and kicking up whirlwinds of sand and dead leaves.<br>One corner of the sheet ballooned with wind like the sail of a great ship. Then the loose flap of sheet flipped over, exposing an emaciated, graying female profile, replete with the wet, matted net of black hair tangled with leaves, the hint of a bruised arm, the flank striated with ribs, and the swell of one tiny white breast.<br>It was the first dead body I&#x2019;d ever seen, and it was strangely unreal. The mind-numbing barrage of fake blood and guts my friends and I digested each weekend watching horror movies at the Juniper somehow felt more authentic than this.<br>The head was turned slightly to the left, and I made out what could only be described as a bloodied dent on the right side of her scalp. That side of her head looked caved in, her right eye winking just below the unnatural concave of flesh.<br> Holy shit,&#x201d; Scott uttered. Apparently, he had seen it, too.<br> The paramedics were clumsy covering the body back up. They rushed too quickly to do it and fumbled with the sheet. For a second there was a bit of tug-of-war before the sheet was replaced over the dead girl&#x2019;s head. One of the officers even tucked the sheet beneath her, securing it.<br>To my left, Scott stared across the road, his headphones providing a rather discordant soundtrack to the moment. Peter stood just slightly ahead of us, the wings of his coat beating in the gathering wind, his hands stuffed into the too-tight pockets of his jeans. He&#x2019;d seen it, too.<br> No one said a word. We watched as they stowed the body into the back of the ambulance. Everyone moved with incredible slowness. It seemed inappropriate. The discovery of a dead body in the woods should not elicit such lethargy. It was fake, all of it.<br> The Piper,&#x201d; Scott whispered.<br> No.&#x201d; I still couldn&#x2019;t comprehend any of it. And I couldn&#x2019;t shake the dead girl&#x2019;s visage from my mind. I feared I would see it in my sleep tonight. They&#x2019;ve never found any of the Piper&#x2019;s victims. Anyway, there might not even be a Piper.&#x201d;<br> There&#x2019;s a Piper,&#x201d; Scott said with unwavering certainty.<br> Do you think it&#x2019;s anyone we know?&#x201d; Peter asked. You guys hear of anyone else gone missing?&#x201d;<br> I shook my head. But of course he couldn&#x2019;t see me because he was watching the paramedics start up the ambulance.<br>A cloud of smoke belched from the ambulance&#x2019;s exhaust. I realized I was waiting for the sirens to come on, but they never did. Of course they didn&#x2019;t. Why would they? What was the hurry now? Yet for whatever reason, I wanted them to hurry. It seemed disrespectful to whoever was under that sheet for these policemen and paramedics to move so slowly.<br> Did you guys get a good look?&#x201d; Peter went on. Did you recognize her, Angie?&#x201d;<br> I don&#x2019;t think so. It&#x2019;s hard to tell. Her face wasn&#x2019;t . . .&#x201d; But I didn&#x2019;t need to finish the thought. Her face had been broken, and Peter and Scott had seen it just as clearly as I had.<br> I wonder if it was someone from school,&#x201d; Peter said, finally turning around. His cheeks were rosy from the cold. His eyes gleamed. You think she could be from Stanton?&#x201d;<br> I haven&#x2019;t heard of anyone else having gone missing,&#x201d; I told him.<br> She was young,&#x201d; Scott said. I registered a twinge of disbelief in his voice. Not a grown-up, I mean. Did you guys see her?&#x201d;<br> Yes,&#x201d; I said. I saw her. I saw her.&#x201d; <br> She could be from school,&#x201d; Peter said. I didn&#x2019;t recognize her but she could have been . . .&#x201d;<br> Too many cops were staring at us now. With all the commotion over, we were no longer curious onlookers. In our canvas army jackets with Nirvana and Metallica patches sewn on the sleeves, we were burgeoning troublemakers.<br> Let&#x2019;s get out of here,&#x201d; I said.<br> We hoofed it down Counterpoint against the wind. Skipping out on tonight&#x2019;s get-together at the docks suddenly didn&#x2019;t sound all that bad. Just imagining the freezing wind riding in off the black waters of the Chesapeake Bay caused something deep within the center of my body to clench up.<br> That caved-in side of the head, that unnatural creasing of the right side of her face. Did I really see what I thought I saw?<br> I trembled.<br> In collective silence, we sought refuge from the cold inside the bus stop portico at the end of the block. Scott changed tapes in his Walkman, and Peter distributed fresh cigarettes. Smoking, we watched the traffic on Governor Highway. Across the street, the two- and three-story concrete buildings looked like pencil drawings in the gray and fading afternoon. Multicolored vinyl flags fluttered above OK Used Kars, the half-empty car lot riddled with potholes.<br>Farther along the road, the lights of Bagel Boutique abruptly went dark, their business done for the day. I&#x2019;d worked there last summer, dragging myself from bed at four o&#x2019;clock in the morning to twist dough into rings, dump...</p><h2>Castle Dreams</h2><p>A would-be usurper to the throne of Lord Incarnadine, now dead, has the Realms Perilous in a spell-induced uproar that has all the inhabitants battling for the throne.

The groundbreaking book aims to serve as an <b>encyclopedia of the mezcal world</b>, examining the spirit from every angle including tradition, science, economics and biology. The snappy book, which <b>Chef Rick Bayless calls a "must"</b>, will put readers in the head of Schroeder as he dives deep into the world of the spirit while delivering reams of information in a light and humorous tone. <br><br>Sections include: Mezcal as a Term, Agave, Agave &amp; Humans, Making Mezcal, Distillation, Agave Types, Economic Realities, On Tradition, The State of Tequila, and The Future. Understanding Mezcal is work that will set the bar for spirits writing moving forward. Much of the book, which features more than 70 hand-drawn illustrations by Mexico City-based illustrator Polly Jim�nez, contains source material that has never before been published on the topic. <br><br>This is a bookshelf mainstay for any bartender who has a bottle of mezcal on the back bar.</p><p>"I was sitting next to Jay Schroeder one night a few years ago on his first trip to Oaxaca, as we tasted one mezcal after another. Most first timers are mesmerized by stories and experiences of the exotic, rustic distilleries and the mezcaleros with craggy faces and well-worn hands. Not Jay. Right away, he was deep into conversations about still types, fermentation vessels, different flavor expressions of the same agave depending on climate, soil, maturity, fermentation, and on and on. The book captures that side of Jay's boundless curiosity and formidable understanding of the science behind the wide range of deliciousness mezcal offers. For anyone who wants to scratch past the surface of mezcal's stories presence, to understand why it is one of the world's most complex and varied distillates, this book is a must."<b> -Chef Rick Bayless</b><br>&nbsp;<br>"Understanding Mezcal is exactly what the growing community of engaged mezcal drinkers have been waiting for. Extensively researched, comprehensively detailed, yet concise and easy to digest at the same time.

It should not have been necessary: by 1870 those rights were set in the Constitution. This is the story of the terrorist campaign that took them away.</b>&nbsp;Nicholas Lemann opens his extraordinary new book with a riveting account of the horrific events of Easter 1873 in Colfax, Louisiana, where a white militia of Confederate veterans-turned-vigilantes attacked the black community there and massacred hundreds of people in a gruesome killing spree. This was the start of an insurgency that changed the course of American history: for the next few years white Southern Democrats waged a campaign of political terrorism aiming to overturn the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and challenge President Grant&#x2019;ssupport for the emergent structures of black political power. The remorseless strategy of well-financed &#x201c;White Line&#x201d; organizations was to create chaos and keep blacks from voting out of fear for their lives and livelihoods. <i>Redemption</i> is the first book to describe in uncompromising detail this organized racial violence, which reached its apogee in Mississippi in 1875. <br><br>Lemann bases his devastating account on a wealth of military records, congressional investigations, memoirs, press reports, and the invaluable papers of Adelbert Ames, the war hero from Maine who was&nbsp;Mississippi&#x2019;s&nbsp;governor at the time. When Ames pleaded with Grant for federal troops who could thwart the white terrorists violently disrupting Republican political activities, Grant wavered, and the result was a bloody, corrupt election in which Mississippi was &#x201c;redeemed&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, returned to white control.<br><i></i><i>Redemption </i>makes clear that this is what led to the death of Reconstruction&#x2014;and of the rights encoded in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.

He lives with his family in Pelham, New York.<br><b>Prologue</b><br>Colfax, Louisiana<br>&nbsp;<br>Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873<br>&nbsp;<br>The Negroes had been in control of the village for three weeks now, and it was plain that something terrible was going to happen. Their leaders had left for New Orleans on Wednesday to try to get help&#x2014;meaning, they hoped, a detachment of police or, even better, federal troops, who would come to protect the people in the village. The white militia was encamped out in the countryside a few miles away, and every day it was being reinforced with volunteers, mostly Confederate veterans who had heard the whites&#x2019; call for help, who had taken their shotguns and six-shooters and muskets and Springfield rifles from the Civil War down from the wall and saddled up their horses, and who had come to Colfax to fight for white supremacy. The Negroes, some of them at least, had guns, too, Enfield rifles shipped up from New Orleans in boxes and an assortment of lesser firearms, but by now there were many more people than guns to go around&#x2014;hundreds of people, including women and children, who had come to Colfax because they feared the whites&#x2019; bursting in on their homes and killing them. The Negro headquarters was the county courthouse, a two-story converted stable from a sugarcane plantation. At a short distance from it they had dug rudimentary breastworks, manned by sentries, to stave off the inevitable attack. All around, the Negroes from the countryside were camped out.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeply lodged in the consciousness of the South was the ever-present possibility of a race war in which, in each side&#x2019;s version, it would be mercilessly slaughtered by the other. If the anticipated deaths themselves were not horrible enough, unspeakable atrocities would make them more so. Now the inevitable was about to happen, and the cause was something that registered, in that time and place, as being literally a matter of life and death: politics. The Civil War was not yet ten years in the past. The Deep South was still in a raw condition not far removed from war. The two political parties and the two races were still violently opposed to each other. The great national questions the war had raised had by no means been settled. They were going to be settled now, with profound and lasting consequences for the whole United States, in places like rural Louisiana, by hard men with intensely local concerns, through the means of an armed struggle that, for all the potency of the load of racial fantasy it carried, was really about who could vote and hold government office.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Colfax, Louisiana, was not really a town&#x2014;it was more a settlement, containing just five or six structures, and new even to that status. It was not insignificant, though. It sat in the exact center of the state on the banks of the Red River, a sugarcane or cotton planter&#x2019;s dream waterway because it was navigable in the countryside of central Louisiana, where roads were poor and railroads nonexistent, and because its floods had deposited a thick, rich layer of alluvial soil along its banks. The land around Colfax was lushly green and flat, and there was money in it. Local legend had it that Simon Legree, the plantation overseer in Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin who, in the public mind, symbolized the cruelty of American slavery, was based on a man named Robert McAlpin, who ran a plantation near Colfax called Hidden Hill, which Harriet Beecher Stowe had visited while preparing her book. The area around Colfax was lightly settled, with nearly impenetrable swamps and uncleared woods and labyrinthine bayous; within easy memory, it had been wild country where desperate, lawless people could live free from social control, and even now it was common to hear about sightings of wild animals and to see families of settlers in covered wagons passing by on their way to Texas.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Politically, Colfax was part of an experiment, a new Louisiana that would resemble the abolitionists&#x2019; prewar dream of how the South should be after its defeat in the Civil War. In 1868 a racially integrated (black-and-tan) Republican state legislature had created a new parish along the north bank of the Red River, drawing its boundaries so as to ensure that its local government would be Republican thanks to a Negro population majority. The parish was named Grant after the Republican president of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant, and its seat was named Colfax after the Republican vice president, Schuyler Colfax. To most local whites, these were unpleasantly resonant names: only a decade earlier, federal troops under General Grant&#x2019;s ultimate command&#x2014;he was not far away, in Mississippi&#x2014;had, as one white man from Colfax later remembered it, &#x201c;ravaged&#x201d; the Red River country using techniques taught them by the same &#x201c;experts in extermination&#x201d; that Grant&#x2019;s leading subordinate, General William Tecumseh Sherman, later used in his notoriously destructive march through Georgia. &#x201c;If it were in my power, I would, as soon as possible, change the name of Grant Parish to Lee and the site of her dispensatory of justice to Davis,&#x201d; another white resident asserted, referring to the Confederacy&#x2019;s commanding general and its president.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Easter Sunday 1873, Louisiana was in a state of low-grade warfare. In 1872, while President Grant was being reelected in a landslide, Louisiana had had a close and corrupt election. Both sides claimed victory, and now the state had two governors and two state legislatures, one Democratic and one Republican. A month after Election Day, federal troops dispatched by President Grant arrived in New Orleans, took control of the statehouse, expelled the Democratic government, and installed the Republicans. Grant Parish, appropriately enough given the condition of the state, had two political leaders, one from each party, each claiming control over the local police function&#x2014;the Republican a black Union veteran, born a slave, named William Ward, the Democrat a white Confederate veteran named Christopher Columbus Nash. &#x201c;In his face he bears the indications of all the worst qualities of his race and none of the better,&#x201d; a white organization later wrote about Ward; and, to judge by the one surviving photograph of Nash, he was a pretty rough character, too, with a full untrimmed black beard and close-set piercing eyes. Both men had had long, harsh experiences during the Civil War&#x2014;extensive combat, injury, and imprisonment. They had come, separately of course, to the raw Red River country after the war because they saw opportunity there&#x2014;specifically political opportunity.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening in 1871 Columbus Nash, then deputy sheriff of Grant Parish, led a mob of fifty armed white men to a house outside Colfax where two black Republican officeholders were living. The white men set the house on fire and shot the Negroes when they emerged; one of them survived by playing dead until the whites had left and then escaping. Legally, this incident fell under the category of law enforcement rather than crime, and Nash continued to serve as sheriff. William Ward was said to have killed a white man, or maybe two, that same year, though unlike the incident involving Nash, it was more a popular legend than a proven fact. In the version of the story most often told by the white people in Colfax, Ward had taken his victim out on the river in a skiff, hacked him to pieces with a hatchet, and dumped his remains overboard.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Republicans got the upper hand in New Orleans at the outset of 1873, thanks to the help of the U.S. Army, both Nash and Ward made it known that they wanted to be put in political authority in Grant Parish. The Republican governor, William Pitt Kellogg, vacillated, which was the worst thing he could do for the cause of stability in Grant Parish, and then appointed Ward&#x2019;s Republican forces. A meeting was held at the governor&#x2019;s office in New Orleans in March, with Ward, one of his lieutenants, and two Democrats allied with Columbus Nash. In the presence of the governor, the two sides started arguing, and one of the Democrats warned that if Nash was not made sheriff, there would be bloodshed. Ward returned to Colfax, called together his Republican political allies, and, unable to effect a peaceful transition of power because the Democrats wouldn&#x2019;t permit it, broke into the courthouse at night and took over the machinery of parish government, such as it was.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the whites that was intolerable. They could not accept Negro rule in Colfax, with the freed-slave, plantation-hand majority having legal authority over their former masters. In fact, from the whites&#x2019; perspective, the situation hadn&#x2019;t been tolerable for quite some time&#x2014;probably since antislavery sentiment had become an important force in national politics, years before the Civil War began. Just after the war, white Louisianans had been able to establish firm political control over the state; then, from 1868 to 1872, Louisiana had been ruled by a biracial, moderate, and corrupt Republican regime, and so had Grant Parish. Whether that kind of government could have lasted is impossible to say, because it didn&#x2019;t last, but even before a blacker, more radical version of the Republican Party took power, whites in Grant Parish felt they were living in an upside-down nightmare world. In a deep-rural, almost frontier culture, where most communication was by word of mouth, where they were greatly outnumbered, and where racial issues carried the heaviest possible economic, political, and psychological load, rumor and myth were rife, and they mattered...</p><h2>The Judge&#39;s Task: How Award-Winning Quilts Are Selected</h2><p>Rear cover notes: &#34;If you have entered or attended a competitive quilt show and come away wondering exactly what it is that judges do and how they do it, this is a book you will want to read - from cover to cover!

Her warm, playful illustrations in soft colors invite children into the world of words and flights of fancy. Once there, she gently and humorously guides readers along the path of righteousness, leaving just enough room for children to wonder if that incorrigible Peter will be back in McGregor's garden tomorrow. <i>(Ages Baby to Preschool)</i></p>Mr. McGregor has two things on his mind when he sees Peter in his garden. One is the safety of his lettuces; the other is rabbit pie. Peter was carefully told not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, but some little bunnies have to learn things the hard way. Beatrix Potter's classic story has been lovingly placed at the center of this creative effort, and David Jorgensen has given Peter and his family wonderfully droll and expressive character and charm in his illustrations. On the accompanying audiocaasette, Meryl Streep explores all of the drame, humor, and subtlety of the narrative, and none of its potential to entertain and teach has been left untapped. Musician/composer Lyle Mays has coordinated and augmented the work of both illustrator and narrator with a score that unifies and enlivens the whole enterprise.

Artists learn techniques similar to those used by Rembrandt, Raphael, Rubens, and other master painters of the past, including using glazing with colors over a subtle underpainting of tones to achieve the effect of sunlight passing through stained glass. Through the advent of fast drying mediums artists learn that they will be able to achieve the same richness and luminosity found in the works of the old masters.<br>� The only source available that covers how to create mixed-media artworks with an extensive range of mediums<br><br>� Finished examples provide creative inspiration<br><br>� A valuable reference that includes technical information and demonstrations</p><p><b>Jane Jones</b> has won numerous awards for her paintings, which have appeared in <i>Best of Flower Painting</i> and <i>Best of Flower Painting 2</i>.

Using the fragmentary form, Blanchot challenges the boundaries between the literary and the philosophical. With the obsessive rigor that has always marked his writing, Blanchot returns to the themes that have haunted his work since the beginning: writing, death, transgression, the neuter, but here the figures around whom his discussion turns are Hegel and Nietzsche rather than Mallarme and Kafka.<br><br>The metaphor Blanchot uses for writing in The Step Not Beyond is the game of chance. Fragmentary writing is a play of limits, a play of ever-multiplied terms in which no one term ever takes precedence. Through the randomness of the fragmentary, Blanchot explores ideas as varied as the relation of writing to luck and to the law, the displacement of the self in writing, the temporality of the Eternal Return, the responsibility of the self towards the others.</p><p><p>Lycette Nelson is a doctoral student in Comparative Literature at the State University of New York at Buffalo.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Science: A Closer Look - Grade 6</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>The Dream Directory: The Comprehensive Guide to Analysis and Interpretation, With Explanations for More Than 350 Symbols and Theories</h2><p>When I dream about falling, what does it mean?

An accident? Suicide? Murder? Sowell, who seems to specialize in baseball-death books (The Pitch that Killed, 1989), sorts through the clues in an intelligent study that, like its predecessor, uses tragedy as a springboard for carefully researched baseball history. Delahanty is forgotten today, despite his presence in the Hall of Fame and his spectacular lifetime hitting average (.345, fourth highest ever). Sowell does nothing to resurrect his subject's fame; he's far more interested in observing the social and economic forces that swirled around Delahanty's career. At the time of Big Ed's death, the National League, 20 years old and already carrying a reputation for rowdyism, faced stiff competition from the new, ``clean'' American League. Sowell recounts the battle for dominance between the leagues, as managers and players leapfrogged from one to the other while lawyers, union organizers, and gamblers stirred the muddied waters. Delahanty comes off as a minor figure, playing second fiddle to charismatic characters like pitcher John Montgomery Ward, a Columbia Univ. Law School graduate who racked up 47 wins in one year and was the first player to write a book about baseball. Nonetheless, Delahanty's strange death raises eyebrows. Was he driven to suicide by National League officials? Mugged by a stranger and tossed over the edge? What of the mysterious security guard who kept changing his story? Sowell takes no sides, except that of baseball itself, which he clearly loves. Filled with period trivia (``from the hotel, the players rode to the ballpark in uniform aboard horse-drawn carriages, a ceremony known as the `tally-ho' '') that lighten the tedium of the historical ins-and-outs, making this a hit--a solid double, no more, no less--for baseball buffs. (Eight-page photo insert--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The author of a well-received book about a lethal beanball incident in the 1920s ( The Pitch That Killed , Macmillan, 1989) here writes about Big Ed Delahanty, a turn-of-the-century slugger who met his death under peculiar circumstances. Thrown off a train while in a highly intoxicated state, Big Ed staggered and plunged into the Niagara Falls on July 2, 1903. Was the death an accident, or was it engineered by the many enemies he had made at a time when the brand-new American League was challenging the stalwart National League for players and recognition? Both a mystery and a history of baseball's early years (about which there is growing interest), this book should appeal to many readers.

Journalist Gary Zukav and the others present developed the idea of physics as the dance of the Wu Li Masters--the teachers of physical essence. Zukav explains the concept further:<p> </p><blockquote> The Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter.... This book deals not with knowledge, which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which is Wu Li.... Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it. </blockquote><p> The "new physics" of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory, particle physics, and relativity. Even as these theories age they haven't percolated all that far into the collective consciousness; they're too far removed from mundane human experience not to need introduction. <i>The Dancing Wu Li Masters</i> remains an engaging, accessible way to meet the most profound and mind-altering insights of 20th-century science. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Yellow Wallpaper and Other Stories</h2><p>One of 60 low-priced classic texts published to celebrate Penguin&#39;s 60th anniversary. All the titles are extracts from &#34;Penguin Classics&#34; titles.</p><p>Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935) was a prominent American sociologist, novelist, writer of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction, and a lecturer for social reform. She was a utopian feminist during a time when her accomplishments were exceptional for women, and she served as a role model for future generations of feminists because of her unorthodox concepts and lifestyle. Her best remembered work today is her semi-autobiographical short story The Yellow Wallpaper which she wrote after a severe bout of postpartum psychosis.In 1892 an unnamed woman passes the slow days of summer writing down her innermost thoughts while convalescing. Her observations focus on the strange effects of the peeling, fading, yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. The Spencer Library has created a unique audio experience in this chilling tale with profound psychological and moral implications. Claudette Sutherland gives a remarkable performance. Her subtly expressive voice is so skillfully recorded that her soft intakes of breath have a desperate life of their own. The haunting beauty of Carol Nethen&#39;s original score can momentarily distract, but it supports more than it interferes, a tribute both to the composer and to the excellence of the recording standards. The listener is rewarded with a fully realized dramatic performance with a strong musical presence. C.T.

Nolan)</h2><p>After being charged with murder, Perry Mason creator Erle Stanley Gardner calls on Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett to help him prove his innocence and uncover the real killer, in a mystery set against the backdrop of Hollywood&#39;s Golden Age.</p><p><p><strong>Barrett Whitener</strong> has been narrating audiobooks since 1992. His recordings have won several awards, including the prestigious Audie and seven Earphones Awards. <em>AudioFile</em> magazine has named him one of the Best Voices of the Century. He lives in Washington, DC.</p>Though he's been estranged from his wife Natalie for years, Erle Stanley Gardner thinks he's about to be restored to the love of his life: Amy Latimer Thompson, whom he pushed into marriage with Hollywood star Tink Thompson because a lawyer-turned-pulp-writer couldn't offer her anything like Tink's money or status. Now Amy, shocked by the way unloving Tink's hounded their little boy to a fatal accident, has turned up on Gardner's door with every indication that she's ready to turn down his sheets tonight and every night. But the bright promise is only a teaser, as Gardner finds out when Amy is murdered and her last-minute will leaving everything to her old flame brings the LAPD down on Gardner's neck. How can he prove his innocence? By using his connections with fellow Black Mask alumni Dashiell Hammett (who offers to hide him from the cops) and Raymond Chandler (who talks a judge into setting a bail low enough for Hammett, flush with MGM cash, to pay). The ensuing investigations into Tink's amours (betrayals, secret marriages, love children) don't bear any closer scrutiny than the climactic scene that brings Perry Mason's creator into the courtroom as his own free-wheeling counsel, but they do give the Black Mask boys an excuse for doing some more high-spirited roughhousing and running into historical figures from Gloria Swanson to Barney Oldfield. An amiable valentine to 1937 Los Angeles that's more ragtag than Chandler's alleged contribution to Nolan's Black Mask trilogy (The Marble Orchard, 1996) and a lot shaggier than Gardner's own work. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this thrilling collection, Marie Heaney provides a sampling of one of the world's greatest literary traditions. She divides the stories into the three cycles scholars have established for Irish literature: the Mythological cycle, the Ulster cycle, and the Fenian cycle, providing a brief introduction to each. From the "Children of Lir," in which a king's four children are turned into swans by an angry stepmother, to "Bricriu's Feast," the bloody tale in which the champion of Ulster is determined, to "Oisin in the Land of Youth," about a man who is lured to the Land of Youth, only to return to his homeland centuries later and become withered and ancient, these stories are riveting. Patrick James Lynch's sweeping, dramatic illustrations reflect the glorious, beautiful, horrifying, or sometimes downright gory nature of the myths and legends of Ireland. If the nine tales themselves don't give readers delicious fodder for nightmares, the pictures will! For the truly insatiable, a section with further reading, source notes, and a pronunciation guide is provided. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Heaney delves into the roots of Irish lore for her collection of eight tales. Conflict, murder and magic abound as kings and chieftains fight one another over beautiful women or to win honor.The author, the wife of Seamus Heaney, divides the volume into the three accepted cycles of early Irish literature (the mythological, Ulster and Finn cycles), providing a brief explanation of the period as well as tales representative of each. Readers meet a variety of Ireland's ancient heroes and villains as they conquer lands and such peoples as the Tuatha De Danaan, who later became known as the Faery or Little Folk that live under the earth in the Land of Youth. Heaney includes all the necessary elementsAdrama, intrigue, ambition, wizardryAbut something is amiss when she strings them together. The narrative becomes mired in copious, often confusing detail (e.g., a brief mention of the character Morann in "The Birth of Cuchulainn" goes unexplained) and difficult-to-pronounce names (a key is provided at book's end). "The Children of Lir," for instance, gets bogged down in logistics and is not as musical as Malachy Doyle's version in his recent Tales from Old Ireland; the writing overall lacks spark and a smooth storytelling pace. Young readers will likely find this work more tough-going than tantalizing. Lynch (The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey) serves up a theatrical pastiche of watercolor-and-gouache, capturing kings, maidens, druids and cherubic babies in his striking portraits and creating sweeping scenes of the harsh and rugged Irish landscape (and seascape) of yore.

Lupe's wealthy new clients, Lucia and Jos&#x201a; Antonio Moreno, want her to find the birth mother of their daughter Michelle, now a year and a half old. Adopted at two weeks through well-known lawyer Elio Betancourt, Michelle has a rare, inherited disease and can be saved only by bone marrow from her mother. Betancourt, however, is running an illegal, very lucrative baby-selling racket and will tell the Morenos nothing. Lupe, then, begins with a search through Dade County records and some quizzing of her usual contacts, turning up the name of the obstetrician, now vanished, but little else. Her surveillance of the lawyer's ongoing operations, though, reveals that his source for infants is not in Florida, but in Cuba, with secretive boatman Alberto Cruz and massive, ever-pregnant Barbara Perez making the dangerous runs by sea. After Cruz is found stabbed to death, the emotional Lupe, a more volatile version of her sisters in detection, feels compelled to make the run with Barbara--her only chance of finding Michelle's mother. A hellish trip it is, too, producing a high body count but accomplishing Lupe's mission. The plot tends to ramble, and characters don't always come to life, despite the attention lavished on them, but the Cuban- AmericanCatholic background is a facet of Florida life not often explored in this genre.

Kublai's life encompassed far more than that fateful relationship, although one entire chapter of this book is devoted to it. The first Mongol leader to conquer and rule all of China, Kublai not only carried on the Mongol tradition of military conquest, but also became a patron of the arts and sciences. As with other titles in this series, Kublai Khan places the subject in historical context. The introductory chapter describes the Mongols' nomadic culture and points out the factors that enabled them to become a military juggernaut, conquering territories from the steppes of Russia to Indochina. In addition to giving Kublai's many successes, Dramer is fair in detailing the Khan's failed military expeditions against Japan and Java and the continual internal strife with which he dealt. Black-and-white illustrations and photographs are abundant, but there are too few detailed maps. A well-rounded portrait. --David N.

Teachers are increasingly finding themselves ill-equipped with the know-how, tools, and strategies to teach students about social awareness, emotional intelligence, and self-regulation of behavior. If you&#39;ve ever wanted, or needed, to make a case for social instruction to be added to a student&#39;s treatment plan, social goals written into a student&#39;s IEP, or social thinking lessons infused into a classroom or campus curriculum plan, Why Teach Social Thinking? drives home the importance of social learning to a student&#39;s academic success and later success in life. Author Michelle Garcia Winner connects the dots from social emotional learning to the Common Core Standards to increased likelihood of success in adulthood. Through exploring 12 core questions, Winner attempts to raise awareness of the many complex and interrelated issues that are at the heart of teaching social skills. 1.What are social skills? 2.What are the origins of social development? Is there an age when our social development stops? 3.In what areas of social thinking do students with social cognitive challenges struggle? The ILAUGH Model remodeled 4.What impact do weaknesses in social conceptual information have on learning the Common Core State Standards? 5.When do we use social thinking and related social skills? How do we approach teaching these skills? 6.How can cognitive behavior therapy address teaching social thinking and related social skills? 7.Do all those with ASD-SCD benefit from the same teachings?

Reprint.</p><p>This is the fourth volume in Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling's ongoing anthology series that invites modern authors to rewrite classic fairy tales. Like many of the original stories themselves, these retellings are often dark, and many contain erotic subtexts. While some of the authors choose to stick to the more traditional aspects of folklore, others reinvent their tales entirely, such as the seven dwarfs who turn into "Three Dwarfs and 2000 Maniacs" at the hands of author Don Webb. As usual, Datlow and Windling have managed to enlist an impressive roster of professional writers for their project, with headliners such as Joyce Carol Oates, John Crowley, and Jane Yolen. These seasoned veterans are mixed in with some relative newcomers to create a collection that is as diverse as it is unique. <i>--Craig E.

Basing his investigations on the findings of the anthropologists, Freud came to the conclusion that totemism and its accompanying restriction of exogamy derive from the savage&#x2019;s dread of incest, and that taboo customs parallel closely the symptoms of compulsion neurosis. The killing of the &#x201c;primal father&#x201d; and the consequent sense of guilt are seen as determining events both in the tribal pre-history of mankind, and in the suppressed wishes of individual men. <br> &nbsp;<br> Both totemism and taboo are thus held to have their roots in the Oedipus complex, which lies at the basis of all neurosis, and, as Freud argues, is also the origin of religion, ethics, society, and art.</p><p>In this brilliant exploratory attempt to extend the analysis of the individual psyche to society and culture, Freud laid the lines for much of his late thought, and made a major contribution to the psychology of religion.

Between the ages of four and eighty-two his home was in Vienna; in 1938 Hitler's invasion of Austria forced him to seek asylum in London, where he died in the following year.His career began with several years of brilliant work on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. He was almost thirty when, after a period of study under Charcot in Paris, his interests first turned to psychology, and another ten years of clinical work in Vienna (at first in collaboration with Breuer, an older colleague) saw the birth of his creation, psychoanalysis. This began simply as a method of treating neurotic patients by investigating their minds, but it quickly grew into an accumulation of knowledge about the workings of the mind in general, whether sick or healthy. Freud was thus able to demonstrate the normal development of the sexual instinct in childhood and, largely on the basis of an examination of dreams, arrived at his fundamental discovery of the unconscious forces that influence our everyday thoughts and actions. Freud's life was uneventful, but his ideas have shaped not only many specialist disciplines, but the whole intellectual climate of the last half century.</p><h2>The White Dragon (In Fire Forged, Part 1)</h2><p><b>By the author of <i>In Legend Born</i></b><br><br>It is a time of vast changes in the island nation of Sileria. Oppressed for centuries by one conqueror after another, this land of fierce pride and ancient rivalries awaited the prophesied Firebringer, who would free them. Josarian, a mountain peasant, survived his leap into the volcano to become the Firebringer. He united the impoverished shallaheen, the magical fire-wielding Guardians, and the vastly powerful mages known as Waterlords in an unprecedented alliance that defeated the foreign Valdani who had ruled Sileria for too long. But now Josarian is dead, betrayed by the alliance and slain by the ice-dragon of Kiloran, the most powerful Waterlord in Sileria. Tansen, Josarian&#x2019;s second-in-command, has taken up the banner of independence, and leads the shallaheen and the Guardians against the Waterlords so that Sileria can be free of a tyranny far worse than Valdani rule. As the volcano goddess Dar rumbles her displeasure in earthquakes and lava flows, the forces of fate, prophecy, and magic combine to create new heroes--from the desolate mountains, from the water-starved cities, from the sea, and even from beneath the earth. Ancient forces join with unlikely allies to fulfill the prophecies that inspire revolt and excite religious fervor. But in Sileria, betrayal has long been a way of life, and it wears many faces as the ambitions of the high and the low ensnare the fates of people across the land, wreaking havoc among the faithful.<br><br>With consummate narrative skill, Laura Resnick brings to life the excitement and adventure of this magical land in its epic struggle to find its true leaders, heal ancient wounds, and chart a path out of chaos to a new day of peace. <br></p><p><b>Laura Resnick</b> was born in Chicago, Illinois. A childhood of being thrown by horses, bitten by dogs, and terrorized by the Resnicks' notorious exploding water well helped prepare her adequately for her future in the publishing industry.<br> <br>Resnick went on to study French, Italian, and linguistics at Georgetown, graduating <i>cum laude</i>. Shortly thereafter, she tramped around most of the Old World, looking at lots of cool paintings, working in France, and winding up on a kibbutz in Israel for a while. She studied acting at the Webber Douglas Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in London, and spent a volatile but happy year teaching English at the University of Palermo in Italy.<br> <br>By the time she was thirty, Resnick had sold a dozen romance novels, all but one of them written under the pseudonym Laura Leone, and <i>Romantic Times </i>magazine named her the best new writer in her genre. She then went on an overland journey across Africa. Everything you could ever want to know about that 8-month journey is recounted in the award-winning nonfiction book, <i>A Blonde In Africa.</i><br><br>While she was in Africa, Resnick won the John W. Campbell Award as Best New Science Fiction/Fantasy Writer in recognition of the short stories she had been writing. Having thus warmed up her muscles, she wrote her first fantasy novel, <i>In Legend Born</i> -- a project which made crossing Africa overland seem easy by comparison. <br><b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br>When the last dragonfish is dead, then will I set my foot upon land.<br>--Motto of the Lascari Clan<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The deck of the fishing boat rolled beneath Zarien's feet, rocking and soothing him as it had every day of his life, since the moment he'd been hauled out of the sea where he had been born. For as long as Sileria's sea-born folk had existed, their women had given birth to their generations in sacred coves, then midwives blessed the infants with ritual immersions before passing them to waiting paternal arms aboard nearby boats. It had now been some fourteen years since the midwife had held Zarien underwater to introduce his spirit to the spirit of the dragonfish, whom his people feared, fought, and must someday vanquish.<br>And for fourteen years Zarien had lived by the creed which bound his clan, the Lascari--and many other sea-born clans--to life upon the waves: He had not set foot upon land, not once in his life.<br>True, many sea-born folk did walk among the landfolk of Sileria. They traded on shore and supplied the floating markets upon which sea-bound clans like the Lascari relied for those things which the sea did not provide. They met with smugglers, rebels, and outlaws on land. They personally delivered cargoes, carried from the nations surrounding the Middle Sea, to wealthy merchants, aristocrats, and waterlords. Some had even marched inland to meet the Firebringer himself, Josarian, to pledge the many clans of Sileria's sea-born folk to his cause.<br>But the Lascari did not walk the dryland, nor would they until the last dragonfish in the Middle Sea was finally dead. Since before memory began, since before there had been waterlords in Sileria or the Palace of Heaven in Kinto, since before the empire of the Moorlanders had risen from the mists or disappeared centuries later into ashes, since before the Valdani had built the great city of Valda and struck out to conquer so much of the world, including Sileria...Since before all this, the sea-bound Lascari had thrived without going ashore; indeed, to do so ensured banishment from the clan, without exception. Theirs was a proud and ancient tradition, one to which they clung fiercely. Zarien had been taught not to rudely ridicule clans who mingled with the untattooed landfolk or who profaned their sea-born heritage by treading on solid ground while yet a dragonfish lived, but he was proud to be coming to manhood in a clan which did not do such unworthy things.<br>During the Festival of the New Year this year, he had finally received the tattoos of adulthood, as had all other sea-born children born fourteen years earlier, in the Year of Dark Skies. The intricate indigo markings he now bore on his hands, face, and forearms forever marked him as sea-born, as Lascari, and as a man. But only now might he become a man in truth; if he presented his mother with the heart of his very first dragonfish kill, then he would earn the right to say to her, as generations of sea-born males before him had said to their mothers, "Today I am a man."<br>They called it <i>Bharata Ma-al</i> in sea-born dialect: the Time of Slaughter. Now, as spring ripened into its full promise in Sileria, the dragonfish swam close to shore to lay their eggs in warm coastal waters. Now they were vulnerable. Now the sea-born showed them no mercy.<br>The rest of the year, these ferocious creatures might strike the sea-born folk anytime, anywhere in the Middle Sea. Many a boat had never returned from the open sea, many a man had died in those voracious jaws. No one--not marauding Moorlanders, not Kintish pirates, not the Valdani themselves with their sleek warships--had ever killed as many sea-born folk as the dragonfish had. Zarien's people had faced and fought this enemy since they first took to the sea, and until they had spilled the dark purple blood of the very last one left alive, there could be no peace. Only then would their destiny be complete. Only then might the children of their children's children set their feet upon land.<br>Zarien shrugged and lifted his face to the wind, indifferent to the knowledge that he would never walk the dryland. Why would anyone want to? The sea was the only life for real men, the dragonfish the only enemy worth facing. Let the <i>shallaheen</i>, Sileria's mountain peasants, slaughter each other in their endless bloodfeuds. Let the assassins of the Honored Society kill and be killed in bloodvows which were sworn to serve the power struggles of their masters, the waterlords. Let the vast armies of the world's rising and falling empires grapple for supremacy on the mainland all around the Middle Sea. What concern was any of this to the Lascari and their kind, whose enemy had been chosen for them by their gods at the dawn of time?<br>The sturdy two-masted boat upon which Zarien's family lived drew near the ancient killing grounds of the Lascari, the stretch of coastal waters which they had claimed as their own centuries ago. Zarien's heart began thudding with mingled pride, fear, and excitement. Tonight, for the first time, he would join the men of his clan in the bloody ritual through which they honored their gods and proved their manhood by voluntarily facing the dragonfish. It was during the Time of Slaughter that, for once, the sea-born folk rather than the dragonfish staged the ambush, chose the time and place of the confrontation, and challenged the enemy rather than simply awaiting their unpredictable attacks.<br>By the time the <i>bharata</i> was over, the shores of Sileria would be stained with blood and the sea would be dark with it. Not all of it would be purple either; <i>Bharata Ma-al</i> claimed many sea-born lives, too, every year.<br>The season of slaughter was a short one, lasting only while the first new moon glowed alone, before the second one appeared to join it in the night sky, during the fourth month of the year. It was a sacred span of three days and nights, an opportunity which came only once a year. If Zarien did not slay a dragonfish during the <i>bharata</i>, the traditional time for a first kill, then he would have to rely on chance until next year, on the mingled hope and fear that a dragonfish would attack him somewhere in the open sea. And until he finally killed one, he would be excluded from the rights and privileges granted only to those who had done so. He would also, he reflected sourly, be obliged to meekly listen to the other men's endless boasts wherever boats met and mingled at sea or in Sileria's harbors.<br>"Stop scowling," his mother advised him, brushing past him as she busily prepared the deck to receive the first dragonfish corpse of the <i>bharata</i>.<br>"I wasn't scowling," he corrected. "I was thinking."<br>"You were thinking?" Her dark brows rose. "Ah, for that alone, we should hold a special festival."<br>He scowled at her but didn't retort. A sea-born man who was not respectful to women--especially to his mother--would be dragonfish bait before long.<br>He didn't help her with her work, nor did she ask him to. Work was strictly divided among the sea-born, and each person stayed out of the other's way when it came to chores and duties; boats were small and unsteady, after all, and the sea-born couldn't afford to trip over and bump into each other all the time like clumsy landfolk. So Zarien stayed out of his mother's way and attended to his own work--which currently meant trimming the foresail as the boat drew near the killing waters.<br>Some of the boats of the Lascari clan were already there, and others were arriving even as Zarien's family brailed their sails up to the yard and prepared to drop anchor, positioning their boat for the setting of the nets. The women of each family had folded the huge nets aboard their own boats with care so that they would feed out smoothly and quickly when they were being set.<br><i>Only let this slaughter make me a man</i>, he prayed to the spirits which ruled the sea. Without his manhood, he would not be allowed to carry the <i>stahra</i> he knew his parents had already acquired for him and tried to hide belowdecks without his knowledge. Among the sea-born, the <i>stahra</i> was a deadly weapon with which a sea-born man protected himself and his family from enemies, pirates, landfolk, and dragonfish. To ignorant eyes, though, it simply looked like an oar, something which even the Valdani didn't object to Silerians possessing.<br>Of course, the need to conceal weaponry from the Valdani was changing with the coming of Josarian the Firebringer. A simple <i>shallah</i> turned rebel leader, Josarian had proven himself to be the long-prophesied chosen one of Dar, the destroyer goddess who dwelled in the volcano of Mount Darshon. With few exceptions, all of Sileria's disparate population worshipped Dar. The Honored Society, of course, was one of the exceptions. They had turned their backs on Dar a thousand years ago, during the time of Marjan, the very first waterlord, who had founded the Society. But even the Society--like the sea-born folk--was not openly disrespectful of Dar. After all, Zarien knew, to worship a land goddess like some mountain peasant was one thing, but to openly insult Her and risk Her vengeance was quite another.<br>Sileria and all her peoples had toiled under the rule of various foreign nations for a thousand years, since the days of the Conquest when the Moorlanders had sailed out of their misty western homeland in search of slaves and gold. After them came the Kints, founders of the ancient union of exotic kingdoms east of the Middle Sea; they had ruled here for six hundred years. Two centuries ago, they had lost Sileria to the Valdani, builders of the most powerful empire the Middle Sea had ever known.<br>Through it all, prophecy, prayer, song, and story had spoken of a great warrior who would drive out the conquering powers which enslaved Sileria so that it could be, once again, a free and proud nation. He would prove himself by leaping into the volcano atop Mount Darshon and surviving. For centuries, of course, the mad <i>zanareen</i> kept flinging themselves into the Fires of Dar in an attempt to achieve that ecstatic union with the...</p><h2>Train To Pakistan</h2><p>It is the summer of 1947.

It gives us pictures of two lives--and many surrounding lives--from different angles, as if they had been taken with a stereoscopic camera. Thereby it gives us an impression of depth and substantiality that have been lacking in other memoirs of Paris in the 1920's." -- Malcolm Cowley, New York Times Book Review</p><p>There was no more exhilarating decade in the history of modern letters than the twenties in Paris. They were all there: Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway, Gertude Stein, James Joyce, John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Mina Loy, T. S.

Toklas... and with them were Robert McAlmon and Kay Boyle.</p><p>Their collaborative memoir began as a book written by McAlmon in 1934. In the late 1960s, Kay Boyle revised and edited the book, adding alternating chapters of her own. The result is a marvelous chronicle of the period as seen through two sets of perceptive eyes. As both writers tell wonderful anecdotes--of Joyce on his evening binges, of Stein holding court, of Hemingway at his most vicious--they beautifully evoke 1920s Paris in this sad, funny, informative, and nostalgic memoir.</p><p>"On his side of the dual autobiography (an interesting device which works very well here) McAlmon tells fascinating stories... and he is always honestly direct. You like the man and you like the book... On the other side, Kay Boyle is a delightful writer with a style that can be dazzling, yet strong as steel... It is Miss Boyle who gives us the airy magic of Camelot-Paris simply by telling us the story of her hopelessly romantic life." -- Mario Puzo</p></p><p><p>A beautiful evocation of 1920s Paris in a sad, funny, informative, and nostalgic memoir.</p><p>Robert McAlmon was essayist, poet, and fiction writer, as well as an influential publisher.

Inspired by her interest in Shropshire history, she penned the first novel, <i>A Morbid Taste for Bones</i>, in 1977. This was followed by seventeen more novels and one book of short stories starring the crusader turned monk with a talent for detection. In 1993, she was awarded the Crime Writers' Association Diamond Dagger for lifetime achievement, and in 1999 the CWA established the Ellis Peters Historical Dagger Award (for the best historical crime novel of the year) in her honour. She was awarded an OBE in 1994 for services to literature. Ellis Peters died in 1995, aged 82.The cognoscenti know that Brother Cadfael, the Benedictine monk, practices medicine and solves crimes in medieval Britain. When a wounded Welsh POW is brought to him for treatment, he turns out to be a nobleman's son who can be exchanged for a captive of the Welsh. But before a swap can be finalized, murder foils the plans, and Cadfael must ferret out the guilty party. Philip Madoc, a mild and robust Cadfael, performs with an admirable cast in a typically workmanlike BBC Radio production.

After studying at the Alberta College of Art and Design, he broke into comics first with<i>&nbsp;Skywald</i>&nbsp;and then at Charlton, where he created the character Rog-2000. Following his tenure at Charlton, Byrne moved to Marvel, where his acclaimed runs on&nbsp;<i>The Uncanny X-Men</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Fantastic Four</i>&nbsp;soon made him one of the most popular artists in the industry. In 1986 he came to DC to revamp Superman from the ground up, and since then he has gone on to draw and/or write every major character at both DC and Marvel.<br><br>In a career that has spanned nearly 30 years, <b>Marv Wolfman</b> has helped shape the heroic careers of DC Comics' Green Lantern, Blackhawk, and the original Teen Titans, as well as Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, and Nova. In addition to co-creating <i>The New Teen Titans</i> and the universe-shattering <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i> with George P�rez, Wolfman was instrumental in the revamp of Superman after <i>Crisis</i>, the development of <i>The New Teen Titans</i> spin-off series <i>Vigilante, Deathstroke the Terminator,</i> and <i>Team Titans</i>, and created such characters as Blade for Marvel, along with <i>Night Force</i> and the retooled <i>Dial "H" For Hero</i> for DC. In addition to his numerous comic book credits, Wolfman has also written several novels and worked in series television and animation, including the <i>Superman</i> cartoon of the late 1980s and currently the hit <i>Teen Titans</i> show on Cartoon Network.</p><h2>The Ends of the Earth: 14 Stories</h2><p>Fourteen stories deal with an accidental killing, the Vietnam War, a monstrous transformation, visible sins, dream worlds, addicts, and voodoo</p><p>Lucius Shepard was born in the USA in 1947. From the mid-1960s to the early 1980s he lived in various parts of the world and travelled widely. He won the John W. Campbell Award for best new writer in 1985 and has also won the World Fantasy Award twice.This second collection of Shepard's short fiction is every bit as compelling and impressive as his first, The Jaguar Hunter . Most of the 14 tales here are in the standard Shepard mold, featuring world-weary protagonists, exotic locales and a tantalizing intrusion of the fantastic, which transforms the characters and their perceptions. Shepard's hypnotic, flowing, generous prose, his keen perception and bold honesty make stories such as the brooding ``The Ends of the Earth,'' the phantasmagorical ``Bound for Glory,'' and the moving tale of time-travel and fate, ``Aymara,'' thoroughly modern and literarily satisfying. Shepard has been called an American magic realist, but this label is more deceptive than telling. Though the occasional story, such as ``Life of Buddha,'' suggests a comparison with the work of Fuentes or Garcia Marquez, the roots of Shepard's fiction lie instead in the North American pulp tradition. The magic realists treat the supernatural as miraculous, inexplicable by human logic, but Shepard's ghosts and magic obey rules different from our world's yet comprehensible to his characters and to the reader. The haunting power of these tales, along with the high-quality production and striking illustrations, make this book essential for any fantasy reader's library. <p></p><p>Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Shadowmask: Stone of Tymora, Book II</h2><p>Cross swords with a blue-skinned pirate and unravel the mystery of the masked spellcaster in this second book of the Stone of Tymora trilogy!<br> <br> Though robbed by a masked spellcaster and left for dead by a demon, twelve-year-old Maimun refuses to give up the magic that rightfully belongs to him.

Mackin </b>(1898&#x2013;1974) joined the Marine Corps in early 1918 and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment on the second day of the battle of Belleau Wood, June 7, 1928. Mackin was awarded the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, and two army Silver Star citations for his valor from Octoer 3-5, 1918, at Blanc-Mont.A real curiosity: a highly mannered WW I diary, published nearly 80 years after being written and 20 years after its author's death. Mackin (1898-1974) entered WW I in June 1918 as a 19-year-old Marine infantryman. He was immediately thrust into the front lines. The ``Boche'' crouched a thousand feet away, on Hill 142 in the Belleau Wood of France; it was the job of Mackin and other raw boys ``full of restlessness and spice'' to win the hill and then the war. They did--although not, as this stylish diary makes clear, without exposing themselves to unspeakable horrors. Mackin, who refers to himself in the third-person as ``Slim,'' plunged into the action by volunteering for the ``suicide squad'' as a ``runner,'' a man who steered soldiers into the front lines. Within days of arrival, he'd killed his first German, recounted in a passage that reveals the art, sometimes strained, that marks the diary: ``He reached for the tool of his trade. It came up, fitting in snug comfort like the arm of a pal. Its smooth stock caressed him from shoulder to cheekbone. Habit? Training! Target--the half-drawn breath--a finger pressure--recoil.'' Sometimes a young man's lyricism takes over: ``We lay close-hugged to the earth, breathing the reek of mother soil and the mystery of night.'' Bright snapshots abound, like the one of Skipper: When shot in the neck muscles, he unbuttons his collar, cleans the wound with his finger, buttons up again, and returns to work. The horror of war never departs: rain of bullets, threat of mustard gas, corpses sprawled in trees. Mackin didn't fulfill his literary potential; after the war, he worked as a laborer, bus driver, appliance-store owner, and custodian. What a shame: the diary has the faults one expects, and the promise one prays for. A fine addition to WW I literature. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Full color throughout. Never before has Margery Williams' classic tale come more to life than in this extraordinary new edition in which Donna Green truly captures the spirit of Williams' story about a little boy's love for a favorite toy bunny. Both author and artist - whether it be through pen or brush - have the unusual ability to express life as if through the eyes of a child. With nearly twenty superb new oil-on-canvas works painted in a fresh, innocent style that is utterly her own, Green demonstrates how compelling the combination of the two talents can be. Children and adults alike will find it difficult not to lose themselves in the little world of <i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i>.</p><p>A stuffed toy rabbit (with real thread whiskers) comes to life in Margery Williams's timeless tale of the transformative power of love. Given as a Christmas gift to a young boy, the Velveteen Rabbit lives in the nursery with all of the other toys, waiting for the day when the Boy (as he is called) will choose him as a playmate. In time, the shy Rabbit befriends the tattered Skin Horse, the wisest resident of the nursery, who reveals the goal of all nursery toys: to be made "real" through the love of a human. "'Real isn't how you are made,' said the Skin Horse. 'It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.'" This sentimental classic--perfect for any child who's ever thought that maybe, just <i>maybe</i>, his or her toys have feelings--has been charming children since its first publication in 1922. <i>(A great read-aloud for all ages, but children ages 8 and up can read it on their own.)</i><p>Celebrate the Easter season with <i>The Velveteen Rabbit,</i> one of the most beloved of bunnies, as he celebrates his 75th anniversary! This special edition, complete with the original story and artwork as they appeared in 1922, remains a timeless classic in children's literature with over 1.5 million copies in print. Ever since its first publication, this wondrous tale of the velveteen rabbit has delighted readers of all ages with its story of wisdom and love. Few other children's books so beautifully capture the spiritual meaning of Easter as does this simple tale of transformation and redemption through a child's unwavering love.</p><p></p></p><h2>Tacita Dean (Phaidon Contemporary Artist Series)</h2><p>With films, drawings, photographs, audio recordings and installations, Berlin-based English artist Tacita Dean explores the ways that chance and coincidence influence daily life, constructing narratives that connect past and present, fact and fiction, private histories and larger events. Across one archipelago of works - Disappearance at Sea (1996), Disappearance at Sea II (1996) and Teignmouth Electron (1999) - Dean documents the tragic account of Donald Crowhurst and his attempts to fake a solo voyage around the globe, which culminated in his eventual loss of sanity and his death at sea. The works tell the story through various fragments and landscapes, including a magnificent sea vista from a lighthouse beacon that produce what the artist refers to as a 'missing narrative' reminiscent of an atmospheric nineteenth-century seascape painting.<br>Art and cinema theorist Jean-Christophe Royoux uses his Survey to dissect the multiple layers of time - durational and historical - at play in Tacita Dean's work. In the Interview, writer and art historian Marina Warner talks to the artist about the remarkable origins of several of her works, highlighting their charmed relationship to chance. Literature and culture critic Germaine Greer uses the Focus to examine the man and the building at the heart of the three-part film installation Boots (2003). For Artist's Choice, Dean has selected a 1939 poem by W. B. Yeats and a passage from a 1995 novel by W. G. Sebald that both capture the elegiac spirit of her own work. Artist's Writings range from a reflection on the distant South Atlantic Island Tristan da Cunha to a very personal obituary Dean wrote about the Italian artist Mario Merz. Also included are project notes on a half dozen of the artist's key works.</p><p>Maria Warner is Professor of Literature, Theatre and Film Studies at the University of Essex.On the Contemporary Artists Series &#34;The boldest, best executed, and most far-reaching publishing project devoted to contemporary art.

One of the richest and most powerful families in sixteenth-century France, the House of Guise played a pivotal role in the history of Europe. Among the staunchest opponents of the Reformation, they whipped up religious bigotry throughout France. They overthrew the king, ruled Scotland for nearly 20 years through Mary Queen of Scots, plotted to invade England and overthrow Elizabeth I, and ended the century by unleashing the bloody Wars of Religion, before succumbing in a counter-revolution that made them martyrs for the Catholic cause. The history of the Guise family is sensational but true. Though parts of the story are familiar--such as their crucial role in the murder of 4,000 Protestants in the infamous Massacre of Saint Bartholomew--the full scope of their influence has never before been told. Stuart Carroll unravels the legends about this cultivated, charismatic, and violent dynasty, and challenges traditional assumptions about one of Europe's most turbulent eras.</p><p><br><strong>Stuart Carroll</strong> is Professor of History at the University of York.<br><br>"[A] nuanced view of a dynasty legendary for its bloody and treacherous defense of Catholicism....

This special edition contains the entire two volumes of <i>Democracy in America,</i> based on the second revised and corrected text of the 1961 French edition, meticulously edited by the distinguished Tocqueville scholar J.P. Mayer.</p><p>As Alexis de Tocqueville traveled through the young United States, he wrote in his introduction to the first volume of <i>Democracy in America</i>, "the more clearly I saw equality of conditions as the creative element from which each particular fact derived, and all my observations constantly returned to this nodal point." And there is an abundance of observations to be found here, with chapters that consider everything from "judicial power in the United States and its effect on political society" to "why the Americans erect some pretty monuments and others that are very grand."<p> Why does Tocqueville remain one of the most insightful analysts of American society? Certainly there is the comprehensive nature of his project, but one must also take into account the brilliance of his prose, with just the right balance of elegance and clarity. <i>Democracy in America</i> is as accessible to the modern reader as the work of any contemporary journalist, political scientist, or sociologist--and in many cases more so. It is an essential volume for anybody concerned with American history.</p>Alexis De Tocqueville was born in 1805 in Paris.At the age of twenty-five, he visited the United States, and his experiences there would later become the basis for his classic study <i>Democracy in America.</i>He died in 1859.</p><h2>Herman: The Fourth Treasury</h2><p>"The low, mean wit of Jim Unger makes <i>Herman</i> uncommonly hilarious."--<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>Celebrate <i>Herman</i>'s success with <i>Herman: The Fourth Treasury</i>.

Interspersing vignettes from her own life with history and anecdotes surrounding such notable literary personages as Virginia Woolf and Edith Wharton, Fraser provides a personal, informative, brilliant, and compassionate book.</p><p><i>Ornament and Silence</i> is a highly personal and exquisitely well-written collection of essays that address the relationships between women and the creative process. The subjects of Fraser's essays are mostly writers and artists, mostly famous, and mostly dead. Fraser's engagement with them, however, is immediate, and her interests are timely and self-revealing. This collection considers how women's artistic accomplishments are bundled up with their relations toward men. This theme is explored in particular in an essay on Russian writer Nina Berberova, whose literary career did not take off until she left her male lover, as well as an essay concerning the impact of sexual abuse on the life and work of Virginia Woolf. These essays are exceptional in their vibrancy and lack of didacticism. The very personal element of Fraser's theme comes through in her poignant essay entitled "Meat," in which Fraser describes her own failed marriage, her artistic struggles, and her writing career at <i>The New Yorker</i> under William Shawn.Most of the essays in this polite, polished collection, which appeared previously in either The New Yorker or Vogue, concern women only in relation to the men in their lives. A "daughter of the paternal old New Yorker" in her youth, Fraser (Scenes from the Fashionable World, LJ 8/87) has moved on with time, taking for her more mature role models Nina Berberova, Edith Wharton, and Germaine Greer. Fraser's essays are quiet, thorough, and beautifully paced, testifying to her tutelage under William Shawn, yet her account of her early years playing the feminine object in "boots and velvet hot pants" will exasperate some readers. The juxtaposition of essays on successful male artists?"A Normal Man" (Matisse), "Stones in His House" (Paul Scott)?only throw into relief the sacrificial achievements of the women who surround them, and in the end we are left with the depressing thought, "Women must set aside the bowl they have used to beg for approval and praise." In a concluding essay bidding farewell to The New Yorker old guard, we cheer to see Fraser burning her bridges.

There they&#x2019;ll visit dear friends Joan Hamilton and Larry Hodge and enjoy a week among some of the finest horses, trainers, and riders in the country.<br> <br> But soon after they arrive, events veer mysteriously&#x2013;and murderously&#x2013;off course. First, Joan&#x2019;s ruby and sapphire horsehead heirloom pin is stolen from her private box at the fairgrounds. Next, a young film star&#x2019;s prize three-gaited mare disappears into thin air. There is no lack of suspects, from hotheaded trainers and jealous rivals to vicious ex-spouses. Then a body is found flagrantly murdered and it&#x2019;s obvious to Harry that someone at Shelbyville is sending a strong message: winning is only secondary&#x2013;first prize is survival.<br> <br> As Harry searches for clues, rediscovers life as a married woman, and deals with her upcoming fortieth birthday, her four-legged detective friends are already on the case. But is animal instinct any match for human depravity? Especially with two humans to protect and a killer on the prowl?</p><p>Rita Mae Brown is the bestselling author of several books. An Emmy-nominated screenwriter and a poet, she lives in Afton, Virginia. <br><br>Sneaky Pie Brown, a tiger cat born somewhere in Albemarle County, Virginia, was discovered by Rita Mae Brown at her local SPCA. They have collaborated on fourteen previous Mrs. Murphy mysteries: <b>Sour Puss; Wish You Were Here; Rest in Pieces; Murder at Monticello; Pay Dirt; Murder, She Meowed; Murder on the Prowl; Cat on the Scent; Pawing Through the Past; Claws and Effect; Catch as Cat Can; The Tail of the Tip-Off; Whisker of Evil; </b>and<b> Cat&#x2019;s Eyewitness, </b>in addition to<b> Sneaky Pie&#x2019;s Cookbook for Mystery Lovers. </b><i>Chapter One<br></i>Long, golden rays raked the rolling hills surrounding Shelbyville, Kentucky, on Wednesday, August 2. At six p.m., the grassy parking lot of the famous fairgrounds accepted a steady stream of spectators. By seven p.m., the lot would be overflowing and the shift to backup parking would begin. A soft breeze carried a hint of moisture from the Ohio River about twenty-five miles west, which separated the state of Kentucky from Indiana. Barn swallows swooped through the air to snare abundant insects, as crows, perched on overhead lines, watched, commenting on everything. Cattle dotted pastures. Butterflies swarmed the horse droppings at the fairgrounds. While butterflies liked flowers and flowering bushes, they also evidenced a strong fondness for manure. Each time a maintenance man dutifully picked up the manure, a cloud of yellow swallowtails, black swallowtails, milk butterflies, and small bright blue butterflies swirled up from their prize. No matter how lowly their feeding habits, it was a beautiful sight.<br><br><i>"If I weren't in this blasted collar, I'd snatch one</i>,<i>"</i> Pewter bragged. <i>"Maybe two."</i><br><br><i>"They are tempting,"</i> Mrs. Murphy agreed with the fat gray cat. Mrs. Murphy, a sleek tiger cat, was carried by Harry Haristeen. Pewter was carted by Fair Haristeen, DVM. The cats eagerly awaited the beginning of the first night's competition.<br><br>Shelbyville, the second glittering jewel in the Saddlebred world, attracted the best horses in the country. The show commenced a full two weeks before the Kentucky State Fair, the blowout of Saddlebred shows.<br><br>The four jewels in the crown were the Lexington Junior League, Shelbyville, the Kentucky State Fair at Louisville, and the Kansas City Royal, the only big show held in late fall, November. All the others were summer shows.<br><br>Throughout America, but most especially in Kentucky, Indiana, and Missouri, the Saddlebred shows added sparkle to the season and coins to the coffers. Every town bigger than a minute hosted one, no matter how humble. No one ever accused the Shelbyville show of being humble. A grandstand encircled the immaculate show ring oval. Most of the seating area was covered. The south of the lighted ring was anchored by an imposing two-story grandstand, where food was served if one had a ticket for the feast.<br><br>The aroma of the ribs tortured Tucker, the corgi, walking between her two humans. She drooled with anticipation. "How long before we eat?"<br><br><i>"I don't know, but I could faint with hunger."</i> Pewter sighed.<br><br><i>"Oh la."</i> Mrs. Murphy thought to say more but realized if she started a fight she would unceremoniously be taken back to their suite at the Best Western hotel.<br><br>Harry and Fair paused to watch horses being worked in the practice ring on the east side of the fairgrounds. Booty Pollard, a famous forty-one-year-old trainer with a fully dressed monkey perching on his shoulder, walked next to a junior riding a three-gaited country pleasure horse. The walk, trot, canter horse was one of those wonderful creatures that take care of their young rider. Fortunately for the junior, this mare's three gaits were smooth. They were leaving the ring. Booty turned his head upon hearing another trainer raise his voice.<br><br>Charles "Charly" Trackwell, a big-money trainer and a peacock, shouted at a stunning young woman on an equally stunning chestnut three-gaited horse, Queen Esther. Queen Esther was much fancier than the country pleasure horse Booty's junior was riding. Queen Esther's trot just threw the beautiful woman up out of the saddle. Renata DeCarlo had paid two hundred fifty thousand dollars for the mare. Renata meant to win. She had to work harder than other competitors for the judges to take her seriously, but she liked hard work as much as she liked winning. At thirty-eight&#x2013;although her "official" bio shaved six years off that age saying she was thirty-two&#x2013;she was a movie star and there weren't many stars bred in Lincoln County, Kentucky. While everyone wanted to look at her, spectators and judges could be prejudiced. Envy from others found odd ways of expressing itself. Renata often received a ribbon lower than she should have earned. Her gorgeous mare merited being pinned first, the blue ribbon, more often than not. Shortro, her young gray stalwart three-gaited gelding, also endured lower pinnings than was fair.<br><br>But Shortro, unlike Queen Esther, was happy if he won a blue, red, yellow, green, white, pink ribbon. Queen Esther always wanted the huge best-in-class ribbon, as did Renata.<br><br>Horses, like people, are fully fledged personalities.<br><br>"Relax your shoulders, Renata," Charly growled.<br><br>"Beautiful," Harry commented.<br><br>"Fabulous mare." Fair prudently focused on the chestnut mare, which made Harry laugh.<br><br>They passed the white barn closest to the practice ring, the silver tin roof showing some wear and tear. The old barns might need a coat of paint, unlike the grandstand, but they were airy and quite pleasant. The number of competitors was so great that tent barns had been thrown up to handle the overflow. Each day hundreds of horses competed, some being driven in, vanned, for that day only. Keeping track of what horses were on the grounds proved overwhelming sometimes, because not every horse was competing. Some were companion horses to keep the star horse company. The temporary stalls, bisected by two aisles, were also completely full. The great stables marked off one or even two stalls for a hospitality suite, which would be outfitted with canvas panels and drapes in the stable's colors. Many boasted a tented ceiling inside to further enhance the welcoming atmosphere. An open bar and refreshments added to the festival atmosphere. Directors' chairs&#x2013;again in the stable colors&#x2013;tack trunks, bridle cases, ribbons hanging on the "walls," as well as lovely photographs of clients and horses completed the setting. The labor that it took to create these oases of cheer, along with another stall made into a special changing room for the riders, often behind the hospitality room, amazed Harry each time she visited one of the big Saddlebred shows, which she did once a year. Although a passionate Thoroughbred woman, she loved the Saddlebred. She'd trained a few from Kalarama Farm to be foxhunters. Saddlebreds could jump, really jump, which delighted Harry. The Thoroughbred, with its sloping shoulder and lower head carriage, ideally has a long, fluid stride. The Saddlebred's energy is expended upward, high stepping with some reach, and the head is held high. Go back one hundred fifty years and the two different breeds share some common ancestors.<br><br>Joan Hamilton, one of Harry's best friends, was the driving force behind the breeding program at Kalarama Farm. Her husband, Larry Hodge, trained and also rode many of the horses. As often happens in the horse world, when the right two people find each other, a magic glow shines on everything they touch.<br><br>On the way to the Kalarama ringside box, Harry and Fair strolled the midway crammed with a lot of stuff you'd like to buy and a lot of stuff you wouldn't. The jewelry shop tempted Harry. She stopped to admire a ring with square-cut rubies and diamonds set in a horseshoe. It was the most beautiful horseshoe ring she'd ever seen.<br><br>The ubiquitous funnel cakes cast their special doughy scent over the area, as did hot dogs, ribs, slabs of beef, and delicious chicken turning on a spit. The food shops, jewelry shop, and clothing shops were interspersed with people from the local farm bureau and various civic organizations running the booths, all having a good time. Most of the civic booths were under the grandstand facing the midway. A gleaming SL55 Mercedes lured folks to buy raffle tickets, one hundred bucks a pop, proceeds going to charity. Flattening your wallet proved all too easy walking along this small, seductive thoroughfare.<br><br>The uncovered western grandstand loomed over one side of the midway, and there were booths under it, as well. Everywhere you looked, right or left of the short midway, there was a booth. Right in front of the western grandstand, smack on the rail, were boxes, with six or eight folding chairs inside. These, rented by the great stables, were magnets for the spectators. Riders, breeders, and owners usually repaired to their boxes, which unlike the rented stalls did not bear the stable colors but sported a chaste white rectangular sign with the name of the box owner in simple black Roman letters.<br><br>Joan leaned forward to talk to her mother, the diminutive, lively Frances, and her father, Paul, as they checked their programs. Paul was one of those people who exerted a warm charisma, drawing people to him. Neither of the elder Hamiltons ever met a stranger.<br><br>Harry stepped into the box, Mrs. Murphy in her arms. Fair, Pewter, and Tucker immediately followed.<br><br>After hugs and kisses all around, everyone settled in their seats. Cookie, Joan's brown-and-white Jack Russell, squeezed with Tucker on a seat.<br><br>When Harry and Fair had arrived yesterday, they viewed Joan's yearlings, mares, and colts, and watched Larry work the horses. Harry learned from watching Larry, who knew exactly when to stop the lesson. So many trainers overtrained, the result being the horse grew sour or flat. Since a Saddlebred must show with brio, overtraining proved a costly mistake.<br><br>Frances, wearing a peach linen and silk dress with a corsage, turned to her daughter and said, "Joan, did you show the newlyweds Harlem's Dreamgirl?"<br><br>"Yes, I did."<br><br>Paul, a twinkle in his eye, twisted in his seat to wink at Fair. "You got the dreamgirl."<br><br>Fair slapped the older but still powerfully built World War II Navy vet on the shoulder. "I think we both married our dreamgirls."<br><br>"Paul and I married in the Dark Ages." Frances laughed.<br><br>"Still a honeymoon," Paul gall...</p><h2>Firestorm (Starfist)</h2><p><b>Combat vets David Sherman and Dan Cragg know firsthand the courage, sacrifice, and hell of war&#x2014;and their experiences have made the popular Starfist novels thrill rides of the highest order. Now the explosive action continues on the remote planet Ravenette, where the Marines of the Confederation&#x2019;s 34th Fleet Initial Strike Team (FIST) find themselves up against a full-fledged rebellion&#x2013;and a lethally loose cannon of a commanding officer. </b><br><br> Desperate to thwart unrelenting aliens and their quest to obliterate humankind, The Confederation has beefed up its defenses.

Shipshape can mean spit-and-polish, everything as clean and neat and shiny as humanly possible&#x2014;and then some. These are Marines we&#x2019;re talking about, after all. In a deeper sense, shipshape means having one&#x2019;s body and mind in peak condition, and all of one&#x2019;s gear, equipment, and&#x2014;most important&#x2014;weapons in the best possible condition. Getting himself and all his equipment&#x2014;most important, his weapons&#x2014;shipshape in all regards is one of the most important things a Marine can do to increase his odds of winning and surviving his next firefight.<br><br>Thirty-fourth Fleet Initial Strike Team had been on Ravenette for close to half a year, standard, running hither and yon to plug holes in the porous Confederation Army defensive line, living in vermin- infested bunkers that had been thoroughly trashed by the soldiers who&#x2019;d inhabited them before the army had moved to less severely infested bunkers. They&#x2019;d just fought off a division-size assault, a battle they&#x2019;d won only because the Confederation Army&#x2019;s 27th Division&#x2014;in contravention of orders from General Jason Billie&#x2014;had turned its artillery onto the flank of the secessionist soldiers just as they were about to overrun the Marines&#x2019; positions.<br><br>No, 34th FIST wasn&#x2019;t shipshape, it was . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Shit-shape!&#x201d; Sergeant Tim Kerr shouted as he barged into the bunker occupied by second squad&#x2019;s second fire team. &#x201c;This whole damn squad is in shit-shape!&#x201d;<br><br>Corporal Rachman &#x201c;Rock&#x201d; Claypoole, second fire team leader, spun about to yell back at Kerr, but froze with his face twisted in anger and his mouth open. He froze because he remembered that Kerr was no longer Corporal Kerr&#x2014;another fire team leader just like him, although a good deal more senior and experienced&#x2014;but Sergeant Kerr, his squad leader. Even though the squad leader was a good deal lower in rank than Ensign Charlie Bass, the platoon commander, when a squad leader was in the kind of mood Kerr looked to be in, he wasn&#x2019;t much junior to God.<br><br>Claypoole shut his mouth with an audible clack of teeth and untwisted his face, stifling his anger. He stood a little more erect and looked about the bunker. The room had been crudely gouged out of the coral-like wall of the escarpment that rose above the beach on the north side of the Bataan Peninsula, and its walls roughly smoothed; at least the worst of the protrusions had been knocked off. That was all the finishing the engineers had had time to do when they were preparing the defensive positions for the war now being fought here on Ravenette. Any protrusions they&#x2019;d left had been replaced by gouges and pits, the result of fire from the attacking Coalition division that had nearly overrun the Marines.<br><br>One good thing about the gouges and pits was that they&#x2019;d replaced much of the crud the Marines hadn&#x2019;t been able to scour off the walls when they took over the bunkers from the army. A bad thing was the resulting stony debris scattered about. Not to mention the expended munitions that littered the floor.<br><br>When Kerr barged in and roared his displeasure, Lance Corporal Jack &#x201c;Wolfman&#x201d; MacIlargie jumped as though he&#x2019;d been caught doing something he shouldn&#x2019;t, then just gawped at his squad leader, uncertain of what was coming next&#x2014;he&#x2019;d never seen Corporal Kerr so angry. He guessed that an extra ration of anger was issued to new sergeants.<br><br>Lance Corporal Dave &#x201c;Hammer&#x201d; Schultz had been leaning on the embrasure, looking out over Pohick Bay&#x2014;just because the Marines, with help from the 27th Division, had defeated a reinforced division didn&#x2019;t mean the Coalition wouldn&#x2019;t order another assault. When he heard Kerr, he casually glanced over his shoulder at the squad leader, then just as casually turned back to his vigil and spat a thick stream of saliva onto the glasis that led from the beach to the escarpment. After the battle, the glasis had been carpeted with bodies, parts of bodies, and unidentifiable bits and chunks of gore, all of which had since been removed for mass burial. The detritus knocked from the face of the escarpment still lay on the glasis. Schultz rolled his shoulders. His back hurt from the wound he&#x2019;d received weeks earlier when a metal facing-sheet from a trench fell on him while the Marines were beating off a major assault.<br><br>Kerr&#x2019;s fury really wasn&#x2019;t at the condition of his squad&#x2019;s bunkers, rather it was a mechanism to distract him from his anguish over casualties. He&#x2019;d become squad leader only because the previous squad leader, Sergeant Linsman, had been killed a few weeks earlier. He was in anguish about that, and about having had one man in each of his three fire teams wounded on the operation&#x2014;so far. For that matter, he&#x2019;d been wounded himself. Right, five of the ten Marines in his squad were already casualties, and as far as he could tell there was no end to the campaign in sight. That kind of thinking could lead to despair. Kerr didn&#x2019;t want to despair, so he turned his emotions to fury, and took it out on his men.<br><br>Besides, if his men were uncertain about him, and they kept busy making their bunkers shipshape, they&#x2019;d be less likely to dwell on the things that had him so upset.<br><br>&#x201c;Look at this sty!&#x201d; Kerr shrieked, kicking at the rubble strewn on the floor. &#x201c;I want this bunker shipshape when I come back.&#x201d; He glared at the three Marines of second fire team in order&#x2014;he even glared at Schultz&#x2019;s turned back. &#x201c;And I want you and your weapons and gear clean and ready to stand inspection on my return.&#x201d; One more glare and he spun and left the bunker as suddenly as he&#x2019;d stormed in.<br><br>After a lengthy moment of silence, MacIlargie murmured, &#x201c;What crawled up his ass and died?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wants us too busy to think,&#x201d; Schultz rumbled.<br><br>Claypoole stopped staring at the bunker entrance where Kerr had vanished and slowly turned toward Schultz. &#x201c;Uh, too busy to think about what?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Half casualties.&#x201d;<br><br>Claypoole mulled that for a moment, wondering what might constitute a &#x201c;half casualty.&#x201d; Then it clicked; half of the squad had been casualties so far in the defense of the Bataan Peninsula. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said. Damn good idea. Let&#x2019;s get busy cleaning up this shithole.&#x201d; He grabbed a push broom from a corner and tossed it to MacIlargie. &#x201c;Start sweeping up, Wolfman.&#x201d;<br><br>MacIlargie deftly caught the broom, but instead of sweeping the floor, he cocked his head in thought. &#x201c;Rock,&#x201d; he said slowly, &#x201c;we barely have enough water to drink. How are we supposed to get ourselves and our gear clean enough to stand inspection?&#x201d;<br><br>Claypoole gave MacIlargie a that&#x2019;s-a-dumb-question-but-I-don&#x2019;t-expect-anything-better-from-you look and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re Marines. When we don&#x2019;t have what we need to accomplish a mission, we improvise. When we don&#x2019;t have what we need to improvise, we simulate.&#x201d;<br><br>MacIlargie blinked a few times. He understood improvising, but &#x201c;How do we simulate cleaning ourselves and our gear?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fake it,&#x201d; Schultz grumbled.<br><br>MacIlargie quickly glanced toward the big, taciturn Marine, then started pushing the broom. After a couple of minutes he looked at Claypoole and said, &#x201c;I could use some help here, you know. Why don&#x2019;t you do something?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am doing something,&#x201d; Claypoole retorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the fire team leader. I&#x2019;m supervising. You missed some shit over there.&#x201d; He pointed at a patch of floor that MacIlargie had just swept.<br><br>&#x201c;Supervising, yeah sure, supervising,&#x201d; MacIlargie grumbled. He didn&#x2019;t look at Schultz, still looking out over Pohick Bay. A few minutes later, though, all three Marines were working together to clean out their bunker.<br>First squad hadn&#x2019;t suffered quite as badly as second squad; four wounded and none killed. And, unlike second squad, two of its fire team leaders were both senior and experienced enough to be in line to be slotted into squad leader billets&#x2014;should one become vacant. As a matter of fact, Sergeant Lupo &#x201c;Rabbit&#x201d; Ratliff, the first squad leader, believed that if 34th FIST had not been quarantined, and if its Marines had been rotated out to other units like everybody else in the Confederation Marine Corps, Corporal &#x201c;Dorny&#x201d; Dornhofer, his first fire team leader, would long since have been promoted to sergeant and made a squad leader. But it wasn&#x2019;t Ratliff&#x2019;s place to question the decisions of higher-higher, not even when he believed higher-higher was clearly in the wrong.<br><br>No, Sergeant Ratliff had more immediate concerns than howcomeforwhy nobody was moving on to other duty stations. Word had filtered down that a Marine lieutenant general was on his way to Bataan to take over combat operations from General Billie. Of course, that word was scuttlebutt, and probably as accurate as the idea that Ensign Charlie Bass was the secret love child of Confederation President Cynthia Chang-Sturdevant. Not that Ratliff thought a Marine lieutenant general wasn&#x2019;t on his way, but the idea that an army general commanding a major operation would give up combat operations command to a Marine was just too absurd to consider. Sure, sure, a Marine had relieved the army combat commander on Diamunde. But in that case, the overall commander was a navy admiral, and he had removed the doggie and replaced him with the Marine. Here, the doggie was the overall commander and the admiral was subordinate to him. So there was no way&#x2014;short of all the army generals getting killed&#x2014;that a Marine would get command.<br><br>The straight scoop&#x2014;and Ratliff knew it was straight because he&#x2019;d gotten it directly from Charlie Bass, who had been in the squad leaders&#x2019; meeting that had just broken up&#x2014;was that a Marine lieutenant general was on his way. Bass didn&#x2019;t know what the three-nova&#x2019;s function would be once he delivered the two divisions and two FISTs he was bringing. If it came to the worst, he&#x2019;d be an inspector general.<br><br>Nobody ever wanted to stand an IG inspection, especially not in the middle of a shooting war. But, dammit, Charlie Bass thought third platoon should be as ready for one as it could be. So Ratliff called his fire team leaders together and told them to get their bunkers ready to stand a round of inspections. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care that you don&#x2019;t have the shit you need to get your bunkers properly cleaned,&#x201d; he said when they objected. &#x201c;Do what you can with what you&#x2019;ve got!&#x201d;<br><br>When he dismissed his fire team leaders, he went in search of the other squad leaders.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d your people react when you told them to get ready for an IG?&#x201d; Ratliff asked Sergeant Kerr when he found him.<br><br>Kerr gave him a blank look. &#x201c;What IG?&#x201d;<br><br>Ratliff returned the look. &#x201c;The IG Ensign Bass told us about.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He did?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I had a feeling you weren&#x2019;t listening during the squad leaders&#x2019; meeting,&#x201d; Ratliff said, shaking his head. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d;<br><br>Kerr looked into nowhere in particular. &#x201c;No problem. I was, I was thinking about casualties, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; He hung his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Look at me, Tim.&#x201d; Ratliff put a hand on Kerr&#x2019;s shoulder and drew him close. &#x201c;Come on, lift your head and look at me.&#x201d; When Kerr&#x2019;s head stayed down, Ratliff squeezed his shoulder and gave it a shake. Kerr slowly raised his head and looked into Ratliff&#x2019;s eyes from a distance of just centimeters. Ratliff shifted his grip to the back of Kerr&#x2019;s neck and pulled until their foreheads touched.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen to me, Tim,&#x201d; Ratliff said softly. &#x201c;I know you feel like shit because of how you got your job. So what? Most of our fire team leaders got their jobs the same way&#x2014;someone above them got killed or too badly injured to come back. We&#x2019;re Marines and that&#x2019;s life for us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;B-but I, I . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah, I know. You were almost killed on Wanderjahr and it took a long time for you to make it back to where you could be returned to duty. And then you had to deal with your own mortality. You&#x2019;ve done a pretty good job of it, you didn&#x2019;t let it get in the way of doing your job when you were a fire team leader. Now you&#x2019;ve got more lives to be concerned about.

Her extraordinary powers of empathy are part of what makes her the sort of doctor we would all want on hand for anyone we love, but also give her the ability to write sensitively and beautifully about painful subjects. </p><p>Here Rachel tells her story - of how death was so conspicuously absent during her medical training, which was focused entirely on learning to save lives and was entirely wanting when it came to helping patients and their families to face death. She came to specialise in palliative medicine because it is the one speciality in which what matters is quality, not quantity of life. <i>A Time for Tenderness</i> is about how Rachel came to understand - as a child, as a doctor, as a human being - how best to help patients in the final stages of life, and what that might mean in practice. </p><p>In the same year she started to work in a hospice, her own beloved father was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Always close to her father, it was largely his inspiration that had led her from journalism into re-training as a doctor, and it was stories he had told her as a child that were to prove formative when it came to be deciding what sort of medicine she would practice. But for all her professional exposure to dying, she remained a grieving daughter.</p></p><p><p>Rachel Clarke is a current NHS doctor and former television journalist who cares passionately about standing up for her patients and the NHS.

Behind the palace's veil of prosperity, bitter rivalries and jealousy flourished among the Boy King's most trusted advisors, and after only nine years, King Tut suddenly perished, his name purged from Egyptian history. To this day, his death remains shrouded in controversy. <br><br><b>The keys to an unsolved mystery</b><br><br>Enchanted by the ruler's tragic story and hoping to unlock the answers to the 3,000 year-old mystery, Howard Carter made it his life's mission to uncover the pharaoh's hidden tomb. He began his search in 1907, but encountered countless setbacks and dead-ends before he finally, uncovered the long-lost crypt. <b></b><br><br><b>The clues point to murder</b><br><br>Now, in <i>The Murder of King Tut</i>, James Patterson and Martin Dugard dig through stacks of evidence--X-rays, Carter's files, forensic clues, and stories told through the ages--to arrive at their own account of King Tut's life and death. The result is an exhilarating true crime tale of intrigue, passion, and betrayal that casts fresh light on the oldest mystery of all.</p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Since his first novel won the Edgar Award in 1977 James Patterson's books have sold more than 300 million copies. He is the author of the Alex Cross novels<b>,</b> the most popular detective series of the past twenty-five years, including <i>Kiss the Girls </i>and <i>Along Came a Spider</i>. He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>With the novelist&#39;s speculative &#34;what if . . . ?&#34; and the researcher&#39;s historical legwork, using X-rays, forensic clues, and previous period research, Patterson and Dugard try to prove that King Tutankhamen was murdered. The story shifts between the present to Egyptologist Howard Carter&#39;s early-twentieth-century journals to 1347 BC Thebes and the boy king&#39;s life. Joe Barrett&#39;s slightly sandpapery voice makes the moments in feel as if Patterson himself is speaking. In addition, Barrett&#39;s &#34;veddy&#34; British Howard Carter is fun and informative. In the ancient Egyptian sections, with their romance and court intrigues, Barrett&#39;s reading quivers with excitement. Are the authors&#39; conclusions scientifically grounded? Do they take too many liberties? The bottom line: The storytelling works, and Barrett&#39;s performance makes this three-thousand-year-old possibly true crime an engaging listen.

Nurse used to sing of it when I was a child. She sang of the big tree-trunks, standing close together, with their roots intertwining below the earth and their branches intertwining above it; of their rough coating of bark and queer, gnarled limbs; of the bushy foliage that roofed the entire forest, save where the sunbeams found a path through which to touch the ground in little spots and to cast weird and curious shadows over the mosses, the lichens and the drifts of dried leaves.</p><p>The Forest of Burzee is mighty and grand and awesome to those who steal beneath its shade. Coming from the sunlit meadows into its mazes it seems at first gloomy, then pleasant, and afterward filled with never-ending delights.</p><p>For hundreds of years it has flourished in all its magnificence, the silence of its inclosure unbroken save by the chirp of busy chipmunks, the growl of wild beasts and the songs of birds.</p><p>Yet Burzee has its inhabitants&#x2014;for all this. Nature peopled it in the beginning with Fairies, Knooks, Ryls and Nymphs. As long as the Forest stands it will be a home, a refuge and a playground to these sweet immortals, who revel undisturbed in its depths.</p><p>Civilization has never yet reached Burzee. Will it ever, I wonder?</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER SECOND</p><p>The Child of the Forest</p><p>Once, so long ago our great-grandfathers could scarcely have heard it mentioned, there lived within the great Forest of Burzee a wood-nymph named Necile. She was closely related to the mighty Queen Zurline, and her home was beneath the shade of a widespreading oak. Once every year, on Budding Day, when the trees put forth their new buds, Necile held the Golden Chalice of Ak to the lips of the Queen, who drank therefrom to the prosperity of the Forest. So you see, she was a nymph of some importance, and, moreover, it is said she was highly regarded because of her beauty and grace.</p><p>When she was created she could not have told; Queen Zurline could not have told; the great Ak himself could not have told. It was long ago when the world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and to minister to the wants of the young trees. Then, on some day not remembered, Necile sprang into being; radiant, lovely, straight and slim as the sapling she was created to guard.</p><p>Her hair was the color that lines a chestnut-bur; her eyes were blue in the sunlight and purple in the shade; her cheeks bloomed with the faint pink that edges the clouds at sunset; her lips were full red, pouting and sweet. For costume she adopted oak-leaf green; all the wood-nymphs dress in that color and know no other so desirable. Her dainty feet were sandal-clad, while her head remained bare of covering other than her silken tresses.</p><p>Necile&#x2019;s duties were few and simple. She kept hurtful weeds from growing beneath her trees and sapping the earth-food required by her charges. She frightened away the Gadgols, who took evil delight in flying against the tree-trunks and wounding them so that they drooped and died from the poisonous contact. In dry seasons she carried water from the brooks and pools and moistened the roots of her thirsty dependents.</p><p>That was in the beginning. The weeds had now learned to avoid the forests where wood-nymphs dwelt; the loathsome Gadgols no longer dared come nigh; the trees had become old and sturdy and could bear the drought better than when fresh-sprouted. So Necile&#x2019;s duties were lessened, and time grew laggard, while succeeding years became more tiresome and uneventful than the nymph&#x2019;s joyous spirit loved.</p><p>Truly the forest-dwellers did not lack amusement. Each full moon they danced in the Royal Circle of the Queen. There were also the Feast of Nuts, the Jubilee of Autumn Tintings, the solemn ceremony of Leaf Shedding and the revelry of Budding Day. But these periods of enjoyment were far apart, and left many weary hours between.</p><p>That a wood-nymph should grow discontented was not thought of by Necile&#x2019;s sisters. It came upon her only after many years of brooding. But when once she had settled in her mind that life was irksome she had no patience with her condition, and longed to do something of real interest and to pass her days in ways hitherto undreamed of by forest nymphs. The Law of the Forest alone restrained her from going forth in search of adventure.</p><p>While this mood lay heavy upon pretty Necile it chanced that the great Ak visited the Forest of Burzee and allowed the wood-nymphs&#x2014;as was their wont&#x2014;to lie at his feet and listen to the words of wisdom that fell from his lips. Ak is the Master Woodsman of the world; he sees everything, and knows more than the sons of men.</p><p>That night he held the Queen&#x2019;s hand, for he loved the nymphs as a father loves his children; and Necile lay at his feet with many of her sisters and earnestly harkened as he spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;We live so happily, my fair ones, in our forest glades,&#x201d; said Ak, stroking his grizzled beard thoughtfully, &#x201c;that we know nothing of the sorrow and misery that fall to the lot of those poor mortals who inhabit the open spaces of the earth. They are not of our race, it is true, yet compassion well befits beings so fairly favored as ourselves. Often as I pass by the dwelling of some suffering mortal I am tempted to stop and banish the poor thing&#x2019;s misery. Yet suffering, in moderation, is the natural lot of mortals, and it is not our place to interfere with the laws of Nature.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nevertheless,&#x201d; said the fair Queen, nodding her golden head at the Master Woodsman, &#x201c;it would not be a vain guess that Ak has often assisted these hapless mortals.&#x201d;</p><p>Ak smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;when they are very young&#x2014;&#x2018;children,&#x2019; the mortals call them&#x2014;I have stopped to rescue them from misery. The men and women I dare not interfere with; they must bear the burdens Nature has imposed upon them. But the helpless infants, the innocent children of men, have a right to be happy until they become full-grown and able to bear the trials of humanity. So I feel I am justified in assisting them. Not long ago&#x2014;a year, maybe&#x2014;I found four poor children huddled in a wooden hut, slowly freezing to death. Their parents had gone to a neighboring village for food, and had left a fire to warm their little ones while they were absent. But a storm arose and drifted the snow in their path, so they were long on the road. Meantime the fire went out and the frost crept into the bones of the waiting children.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Poor things!&#x201d; murmured the Queen softly. &#x201c;What did you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I called Nelko, bidding him fetch wood from my forests and breathe upon it until the fire blazed again and warmed the little room where the children lay. Then they ceased shivering and fell asleep until their parents came.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am glad you did thus,&#x201d; said the good Queen, beaming upon the Master; and Necile, who had eagerly listened to every word, echoed in a whisper: &#x201c;I, too, am glad!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And this very night,&#x201d; continued Ak, &#x201c;as I came to the edge of Burzee I heard a feeble cry, which I judged came from a human infant. I looked about me and found, close to the forest, a helpless babe, lying quite naked upon the grasses and wailing piteously. Not far away, screened by the forest, crouched Shiegra, the lioness, intent upon devouring the infant for her evening meal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what did you do, Ak?&#x201d; asked the Queen, breathlessly.</p><p>&#x201c;Not much, being in a hurry to greet my nymphs. But I commanded Shiegra to lie close to the babe, and to give it her milk to quiet its hunger. And I told her to send word throughout the forest, to all beasts and reptiles, that the child should not be harmed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am glad you did thus,&#x201d; said the good Queen again, in a tone of relief; but this time Necile did not echo her words, for the nymph, filled with a strange resolve, had suddenly stolen away from the group.</p><p>Swiftly her lithe form darted through the forest paths until she reached the edge of mighty Burzee, when she paused to gaze curiously about her. Never until now had she ventured so far, for the Law of the Forest had placed the nymphs in its inmost depths.</p><p>Necile knew she was breaking the Law, but the thought did not give pause to her dainty feet. She had decided to see with her own eyes this infant Ak had told of, for she had never yet beheld a child of man. All the immortals are full-grown; there are no children among them. Peering through the trees Necile saw the child lying on the grass. But now it was sweetly sleeping, having been comforted by the milk drawn from Shiegra. It was not old enough to know what peril means; if it did not feel hunger it was content.</p><p>Softly the nymph stole to the side of the babe and knelt upon the sward, her long robe of rose leaf color spreading about her like a gossamer cloud. Her lovely countenance expressed curiosity and surprise, but, most of all, a tender, womanly pity. The babe was new-born, chubby and pink. It was entirely helpless. While the nymph gazed the infant opened its eyes, smiled upon her, and stretched out two dimpled arms. In another instant Necile had caught it to her breast and was hurrying with it through the forest paths.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER THIRD</p><p>The Adoption</p><p>The Master Woodsman suddenly rose, with knitted brows. &#x201c;There is a strange presence in the Forest,&#x201d; he declared. Then the Queen and her nymphs turned and saw standing before them Necile, with the sleeping infant clasped tightly in her arms and a defiant look in her deep blue eyes.</p><p>And thus for a moment they remained, the nymphs filled with surprise and consternation, but the brow of the Master Woodsman gradually clearing as he gazed intently upon the beautiful immortal who had wilfully broken the Law. Then the great Ak, to the wonder of all, laid his hand softly on Necile&#x2019;s flowing locks and kissed her on her fair forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;For the first time within my knowledge,&#x201d; said he, gently, &#x201c;a nymph has defied me and my laws; yet in my heart can I find no word of chiding. What is your desire, Necile?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me keep the child!&#x201d; she answered, beginning to tremble and falling on her knees in supplication.</p><p>&#x201c;Here, in the Forest of Burzee, where the human race has never yet penetrated?&#x201d; questioned Ak.</p><p>&#x201c;Here, in the Forest of Burzee,&#x201d; replied the nymph, boldly. &#x201c;It is my home, and I am weary for lack of occupation. Let me care for the babe! See how weak and helpless it is. Surely it can not harm Burzee nor the Master Woodsman of the World!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But the Law, child, the Law!&#x201d; cried Ak, sternly.</p><p>&#x201c;The Law is made by the Master Woodsman,&#x201d; returned Necile; &#x201c;if he bids me care for the babe he himself has saved from death, who in all the world dare oppose me?&#x201d; Queen Zurline, who had listened intently to this conversation, clapped her pretty hands gleefully at the nymph&#x2019;s answer.</p><p>&#x201c;You are fairly trapped, O Ak!&#x201d; she exclaimed, laughing. &#x201c;Now, I pray you, give heed to Necile&#x2019;s petition.&#x201d;</p><p>The Woodsman, as was his habit when in thought, stroked his grizzled beard slowly. Then he said:</p><p>&#x201c;She shall keep the babe, and I will give it my protection. But I warn you all that as this is the first time I have relaxed the Law, so shall it be the last time. Never more, to the end of the World, shall a mortal be adopted by an immortal. Otherwise would we abandon our happy existence for one of trouble and anxiety. Good night, my nymphs!&#x201d;</p><p>Then Ak was gone from their midst, and Necile hurried away to her bower to rejoice over her newfound treasure.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER FOURTH</p><p>Claus</p><p>Another day found Necile&#x2019;s bower the most popular place in the Forest. The nymphs clustered around her and the child that lay asleep in her lap, with expressions of curiosity and delight. Nor were they wanting in praises for the great Ak&#x2019;s kindness in allowing Necile to keep the babe and to care for it. Even the Queen came to peer into the innocent childish face and to hold a helpless, chubby fist in her own fair hand.</p><p>&#x201c;What shall we call him, Necile?&#x201d; she asked, smiling. &#x201c;He must have a name, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let him be called Claus,&#x201d; answered Necile, &#x201c;for that means &#x2018;a little one.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rather let him be called Neclaus,&#x201d;* returned the Queen, &#x201c;for that will mean &#x2018;Necile&#x2019;s little one.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>The nymphs clapped their hands in delight, and Neclaus became the infant&#x2019;s name, although Necile loved best to call him Claus, and in afterdays many of her sisters followed her example.</p><p>Necile gathered the softest moss in all the forest for Claus to lie upon, and she made his bed in her own bower. Of food the infant had no lack. The nymphs searched the forest for bell-udders, which grow upon the goa-tree and when opened are found to be filled with sweet milk. And the soft-eyed does willingly gave a share of their milk to support the little stranger, while Shiegra, the lioness, often crept stealthily into Necile&#x2019;s bower and purred softly as she lay beside the babe and fed it.</p><p></p></p><h2>Toward a Meaningful Life, New Edition: The Wisdom of the Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson</h2><p><p>With a new foreword and chapter that address the upheaval that followed the events of September 11, <em>Toward a Meaningful Life</em> is a spiritual road map for living based on the teachings of one of the foremost religious leaders of our time: Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.

James Marshall--beloved creator of the unforgettable hippos George and Martha--graces Edward Lear's classic nonsense poem "The Owl and the Pussycat" with his winsome, goofy watercolor sketches in the final work before his death in 1992. As his dear friend Maurice Sendak writes in the afterword of this historic book, "There was never such an Owl and Pussycat, certainly not since Edward Lear, and for my money James surpasses Lear's original pictures in sheer giddy humor and heartfeltness." This is the kind of book that adults wish they had grown up with, and that children will remember their whole lives.

Daniel Bell explains that the point is not simply to know the just war tradition but to live it even in the face of the tremendous difficulties associated with war. He shows how just war practice, if it is to be understood as a faithful form of Christian discipleship, must be rooted in and shaped by the fundamental convictions and confessions of the faith. The book includes a foreword by an Army chaplain who has served in Iraq and study questions for group use.</p><p>"By reframing just war as a discipline of Christian discipleship, Bell has breathed new life into the discussion surrounding this important topic. He has done so, moreover, in a manner that makes this book accessible to those well versed in the debates as well as those who are confronting these issues for the first time. We are in his debt."--<b>Stanley Hauerwas</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"Bell has written a book that I wish I had during my deployments. <i>Just War as Christian Discipleship</i> addresses the just war tradition in a way that not only adds to our knowledge of the historical roots of the tradition but also contributes to the Christian soldier's desire to embody the principles as lifestyle. . . . If the Christian community will take seriously Bell's call for a discipleship that embraces the just war tradition, we can all feel more confident that our nation will strive to maintain the moral high ground in its military endeavors and beyond."--<b>Chaplain Lt. Col. Scott A. Sterling</b> (from the foreword)<br><br>"This groundbreaking book synthesizes the writing style and substance of just war ethicists Paul Ramsey and Oliver O'Donovan with that of pacifist ethicists John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas, resulting in a constructive account of just war that is embedded and embodied in the life and practices of the Christian church. It should be required reading for anyone interested in ethics and just war, especially for Christians in the pulpits and in the pews, in the classrooms and in the barracks. It will become a standard resource for helping Christians who espouse the just war tradition to adhere to it in a way that, as John Howard Yoder would put it, is honest and has teeth."--<b>Tobias Winright</b>, Saint Louis University<br><br>"Important, accessible, and astonishing. Bell asks hard questions about the use of the just war tradition and instead of leaving that burden of conscience on soldiers, chaplains, or political leaders, he puts it where it belongs--on the whole Christian community. The book is a rich introduction to the just war tradition, a thought-provoking look at current military realities, and a clarion call for all Christians to grow in faithfulness to the One who told them to love their enemies."--<b>Kelly S. Johnson</b>, University of Dayton<b>Daniel M. Bell Jr.</b> (PhD, Duke University) is professor of theological ethics at Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary in Columbia, South Carolina. He has worked extensively with both retired and active duty military personnel on the just war tradition.

Its inhabitants lived in prosperous agricultural towns.

The essences are unique in that they do not treat problems per se but instead seek to heal the personality at the center of the problems. They are simple to use, easily accessible and gentle in action, yet powerfully effective. Healing The Family aims at introducing the Bach Flower Essences as a form of self-help family therapy. Readers are exposed to an alternative way of perceiving family life and its many issues and challenges, and taught how to use the 38 flower essences to understand one&#39;s own strength and deficiency in the helper role.

She pursued her interest in the healing arts to become a Bach Foundation Registered Practitioner and Assessor, Teacher and Mentor with the Bach International Education Program for 12 years. She is also a Certified Quantum-Touch Practitioner and founded The SomEsse Method, an approach unique to her practice. Like Dr Bach, the foundation of her healing philosophy is that true health is only possible when individuals are empowered to live from their essence. Her emphasis is on the pathway from body to essence, applying a unified understanding and explanation to different modalities to effect rapid and profound healing and growth in self-wisdom that makes healing complete."There are three things in this book I feel are particularly appreciated contributions to the field. First, that you so clearly and simply explain why flower essences are needed by the whole family when one family member is having the problem. Second, you go into a lot of thought-provoking detail about how the person selecting the essence is a part of the 'system', and can therefore either be part of the problem, or part of the solution - the power of the 'therapeutic relationship' being in my estimation entirely under-rated. And third, I was very much interested in your comments about the potential for using flower essences with an Asian population." --Deborah Bier, PhD, Publisher &amp; Co-Editor of Vibration Magazine, Author of The Encyclopedia of Vibrational Essences<br><br>The flower essence therapy system of the late British G.P. (later bacteriologist and pathologist) Edward Bach is not exactly unknown in the Bay Area, but this is the first American guide we've seen written with families in mind. Yeo, a Sunnyvale pharmacist and Bach Foundation Registered Practitioner, believes that "Dr Bach's essential message is that all ills of mankind are spiritual in nature" and that his essences "act gently yet powerfully "to rid body and mind of negative thoughts and emotions that make us ill. A blend of essay and manual, Healing The Family also explains the seven groups of essences (which treat loneliness, fear, oversensitivity and other stressors), and instructs parents how to choose the appropriate essence(s) and how to use them with both children and adults. (Morever, Yeo doesn't forget the possible ramifications of such treatment, noting "It is tempting to make use of the essences to 'correct' the people who are close to us.") It's an absorbing and thought-provoking little book. --Parents Press Magazine (Berkeley, CA), Sept 2006 issue,<br><br>If you currently have a family or are working through issues of your childhood family or if you just want to broaden your understanding of your role and impact on the 'bigger picture family' of humankind - Healing The Family with Bach Flower Essences is for you!

Drawing on fresh research into Spielrein&#x2019;s diaries, papers, and correspondence, John Launer shows how Spielrein&#x2019;s overlooked ideas&#x2015;rejected by Freud and Jung but substan-tially vindicated by later developments in psychol-ogy and evolutionary biology&#x2015;may represent the last and most important stage in the rediscovery of an extraordinary life.</p><p>John Launer is a GP and medical educator known for his work in consultation skills, clinical supervision, and narrative based medicine.

Throughout his gripping narrative we hear the voices of men and women both eminent and ordinary, some who were spectators on the Home Front, others who were deeply embroiled in epic battles that changed the world forever.</p></p><p><b>Saul David</b> is a professor of war studies&nbsp;and the author of several critically-acclaimed history books, including <i>The Indian Mutiny: 1857</i>, <i>Victoria's Wars: The Rise of Empire</i>, and <i>Zulu: The Heroism and Tragedy of the Zulu War of 1879</i>.&nbsp;He also is&nbsp;the author of&nbsp;several acclaimed historical fiction novels.Absorbing because of, not despite, the harrowing detail. * The Independent * David picks out 100 individual days from the war that allow him to paint the entire picture ... as ever, he is at his best when shells are landing and whistles are blowing. * Sunday Times * All the really important dates are here, as well as some inspired choices ...

But one thing will always be out of his reach ... Everybody who is anybody is seen at his glittering parties. Day and night his Long Island mansion buzzes with bright young things drinking, dancing and debating his mysterious character. For Gatsby - young, handsome, fabulously rich - always seems alone in the crowd, watching and waiting, though no one knows what for. Beneath the shimmering surface of his life he is hiding a secret: a silent longing that can never be fulfilled. And soon this destructive obsession will force his world to unravel.</p><p>In 1922, F Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple, intricately patterned". That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned and, above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace be comes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties and waits for her to appear.

Goodall's work has always been controversial, mostly because she broke the mold of research scientist by developing meaningful relationships with her "specimens" and honoring their lives as she would other humans.<p> Now at the age of 60, she continues to break the mold of scientist by revealing how her research and worldwide conservation institutes spring from her childhood callings and adult spiritual convictions. <i>Reason for Hope</i> is a smoothly written memoir that does not shy away from facing the realities of environmental destruction, animal abuse, and genocide. But Goodall shares her antidote to the poison of despair with specific examples of why she has not lost faith. For instance, she shares her spiritual epiphany during a visit to Auschwitz; her bravery in the face of chimpanzee imprisonment in medical laboratories; and devotes a whole chapter to individuals, corporations, and countries that are doing the right thing. But most of all Goodall provides a beautifully written plea for why everyone can and must find a reason for hope. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>&#34;Dr. Jane Goodall&#39;s revolutionary study of chimpanzees in Tanzania&#39;s Gombe preserve forever altered the very, definition of &#34;humanity.&#34; Now, in a poignant and insightful memoir, Jane Goodall explores her extraordinary life and personal spiritual odyssey, with observations as profound as the knowledge she has brought back from the forest.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. &#34;It has been a life blessed with faith, resolve, and purpose, though not without its crises. Jane Goodall endured the horrors of the London blitz and World War II, postwar hardships, vicious rumors and &#34;establishment&#34; assaults on the integrity of her work, a terrorist attack and hostage taking in Africa, and her husband&#39;s slow, agonizing death. But throughout, her religious convictions, although tested, have helped her survive - and Jane Goodall&#39;s pursuit of science has enhanced, not eroded, her belief in God.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. &#34;In this book she candidly shares her life - talking of the love and support of her mother, her son, her late husband, of friends and strangers - as well as the Gombe chimpanzees she introduced to the world nearly forty years ago. And she gives us convincing reasons why we can and must open ourselves to the saints within each of us.&#34;--BOOK JACKET.</p><h2>The Great Utopia: The Russian and Soviet Avant-Garde, 1915-1932</h2><p>Catalogue for a 1992 exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum, with 318 color plates and numerous black and white illustrations.

The tale spans the years 1784 to 1812 and extends from the Great Lakes to the Pacific, from Athabasca to the Missouri River. A distinguished literary work, the <i>Travels</i> alternates between the expository prose of the scientist and the vivid language of the storyteller, animated throughout by a restless spirit of inquiry and a sense of wonder. <p>In the first of three volumes that will finally bring all of Thompson's writings together, editor William Moreau presents the <i>Travels</i> narrative as it existed in 1850, when the author was forced to abandon his work, and supplements it with a textual introduction, extensive annotations, and historical and modern maps.</p><p><b>David Thompson</b> (1770-1857) is considered by many to have been the most important surveyor of North America. His achievements--mapping the Saskatchewan River, the great bend of the Missouri River, the Great Lakes, and the headwaters of the Mississippi as well as the Columbia watershed--are the stuff of legend.</p><p><b>William E. Moreau</b> is a teacher with the Toronto District School Board and a sessional lecturer with the University of Toronto at Scarborough.</p><p>"Moreau has tackled the thorny text of David Thompson's <i>Travels</i> with a lucid new transcription that sweeps readers across the breadth of North America. Along the way Thompson's disparate parts assemble themselves into a full-blown character, possessed of wit, energy, curiosity, and a keen sense of the human and geographical landscapes through which he passes." -- Jack Nisbet, author of <i>Sources of the River</i> and <i>The Collector: David Douglas and the Natural History of the Northwest</i></p><p>"Thompson's descriptions of his experiences transport the reader to the era of Euro-American contact with Indigenous people in the pre-colonial West like no other -- his observations are among the clearest and most perceptive written during the period. This is an important work and deserving of a wide general audience." -- William L. Lang, Portland State University</p><p>"Moreau integrates new materials and ensures that previously excluded material is now accessible. Scholars have been waiting some time for a complete Thompson edition, and this will be used and admired by historians and anthropologists throughout the United States and Canada." -- Frits Pennekoek, Athabasca University</p></p><p><b>David Thompson </b>(1770-1857) is considered by many to have been the most important surveyor of North America.

It was heralded as "a marvel of invention . . . a virtuoso performance" (<b>The New York Times Book Review</b>) and a "novel [that] stands with the best that our nation has produced as literature" (<b>Los Angeles Times Book Review</b>). Now Peter Matthiessen brings us the second novel in his Watson trilogy, a project that has been nearly twenty years in the writing. A story of epic scope and ambition, <b>Lost Man's River</b> confronts the primal relationship between a dangerous father and his desperate sons and the ways in which his death has shaped their lives. <br><br>Lucius Watson is obsessed with learning the truth about his father. Who was E. J. Watson? Was he a devoted family man, an inspired farmer, a man of progress and vision? Or was he a cold-blooded murderer and amoral opportunist? Were his neighbors driven to kill him out of fear? Or was it envy? And if Watson was a killer, should the neighbors fear the obsessed Lucius when he returns to live among them and ask questions? <br><br>The characters in this tale are men and women molded by the harsh elements of the Florida Everglades--an isolated breed, descendants of renegades and pioneers, who have only their grit, instinct, and tradition to wield against the obliterating forces of twentieth-century progress: Speck Daniels, moonshiner and alligator poacher turned gunrunner; Sally Brown, who struggles to escape the racism and shame of her local family; R. B. Collins, known as Chicken, crippled by drink and rage, who is the custodian of Watson secrets; Watson Dyer, the unacknowledged namesake with designs on the remote Watson homestead hidden in the wild rivers; and Henry Short, a black man and unwilling member of the group of armed island men who awaited E. J. Watson in the silent twilight. Only a storyteller of Peter Matthiessen's dazzling artistry could capture the beauty and strangeness of life on this lawless frontier while probing deeply into its underlying tragedy: the brutal destruction of the land in the name of progress, and the racism that infects the heart of New World history.</p><p>"Intricately structured, richly documented, utterly convincing . . . certain to linger in the memory like an experience we have lived through but cannot, for all our effort at analysis, comprehend." <br>-Joyce Carol Oates, The Washington Post Book World<br><br>"A novel of high ambition and high achievement. . . . Like Twain and Faulkner, Matthiessen has mastered the knack of achieving a literary effect without viola-ting the authenticity of an unlettered voice." <br>-Cleveland Plain Dealer<br><br>"This novel is Matthiessen at his best-a masterfully spun yarn, a little otherworldly, a dreamlike momentum. . . . Like everything of his, it's also a deep dec-laration of love for the planet."<br>-Thomas Pynchon<br><br>"The most beautiful and compelling American novel in decades."<br>-Chicago Sun-Times<br><br>"An original and powerful artist . . . who has produced as impressive a body of work as that of any writer of our time. . . . He has immeasurably enlarged our consciousness."<br>-William Styron<br><br>"One of our best writers." <br>-Don DeLillo<br><br>"When all the faddish smoke clears, Peter Matthiessen's work will stand revealed as that of an artist of immense talent, grandeur, and genius." <br>-Jim Harrison<br><br>"One of our few genuine masters."<br>-Thomas McGuane<br><br>"The best of the North American capacity for risk, self-knowledge, and the transformation of experience into destiny is to be found in the work of Peter Matthiessen." <br>-Carlos FuentesPeter Matthiessen was born in New York City in 1927 and had already begun his writing career by the time he graduated from Yale University in 1950. The following year, he was a founder of <b>The Paris Review</b>. Besides <b>At Play in the Fields of the Lord</b>, which was nominated for the National Book Award, he has published six other works of fiction, including <b>Far Tortuga</b> and <b>Killing Mister Watson</b>. Mr. Matthiessen's parallel career as a naturalist and explorer has resulted in numerous widely acclaimed books of nonfiction, among them <b>The Tree Where Man Was Born</b>, which was nominated for the National Book Award, and <b>The Snow Leopard</b>, which won it.</p><h2>A Guide Book of United States Coins 2018: The Official Red Book, Hardcover</h2><p>The Official Red Book&#x2014;A Guide Book of United States Coins&#x2014;is 71 years young and going strong.

She conjures up the exhilaration of swimming with humpback whales off the coast of Maui; she makes us comprehend the true environmental tragedy of the massive oil spills in Prince William Sound and the Persian Gulf; and she leads us out into Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the epitome of ocean wilderness but also the final resting place for tons of waste that drift in from thousands of miles away. This brilliant, thought-provoking, superbly readable book will inspire a new reverence for the majesty of the world's oceans even as it opens our eyes to the intricate interdependence of all life-forms.</p><p>What have we learned since 1951, when Rachel Carson's charming <i>The Sea Around Us</i> was published, winning so many hearts and the National Book Award? The sea below us, as pioneering marine biologist Sylvia Earle and others have demonstrated, churns with far more life than Carson ever dreamed. <i>Sea Change</i> is an enthusiastic celebration of that diversity and abundance. It's also a profoundly sobering account of the shortsighted human assault on ocean life. The "silent tide," as one reviewer wrote, may lie just offshore. Only a sea change in human habits and economies will save the oceans.<p> Like Carson, Earle carved a place for herself in the public imagination despite resistance from those in her male-dominated field. Her tales of underwater adventure--including many record-breaking dives among the 6,000 hours she has spent underwater--are punctuated by stories about her increasing prominence as an advocate for the oceans. She's seen it all, it seems: a year diving with whales in Hawaii, visits to Prince William Sound and the Persian Gulf in the aftermath of colossal oil spills, etc. Her breezy prose won't win her the National Book Award, but few others wear Rachel Carson's mantle as gracefully. That is reason enough to read <i>Sea Change</i>. <i>--Pete Holloran</i></p>"What Rachel Carson was to insecticides, birds, and our planet in 1962, Sylvia Earle, scientist, explorer, oceanographer, diver extraordinaire, entrepreneur, and eternal romantic, is now to the ocean."<br>--<b>The Boston Globe</b><p>"A moving plea for the preservation of the oceans . . . An adventure story and a tribute to all creatures great and small. Tragically, it is a eulogy, a Rachel Carson-like warning of the silent tide inexorably approaching."<br>--<b>The New York Times Book Review</b></p><p>"With contagious enthusiasm, Earle provides exciting accounts of her deep-sea explorations. . . . Earle gives vivid descriptions of the dramatic sea changes, and she urges readers to be more respectful toward the oceans--for our own sake, if nothing else."<br>--<b>The Seattle Times</b></p><p>"Compelling and alarming . . . In <b>Sea Change</b>, Earle discusses her love for the sea and its still considerable mysteries in a personal voice that rhapsodizes the topic while also instructing us in many of its subtleties and complexities."<br>--<b>San Diego Union-Tribune</b></p><p>"A landmark book of tremendous importance, <b>Sea Change</b> is a masterful blend of meticulous scientific investigation and incredible adventure. Earle's prose is magnificent, her story utterly compelling. It conveys an urgent call to action, an appeal to every one of us who cares about the ocean world on which we are all, ultimately, dependent. After reading this book--and read it you must--you will never be quite the same."<br>--Dr. Jane Goodall</p><p>"A fascinating book--which is also an urgent warning about the damage we are doing to the global environment. Let us hope the world will listen to Earle's SOS--Save Our Seas--before it is too late.<br>--Arthur C. Clarke, CBE</p><p>"Sea Change sounds an alarm and offers hope. No one is better qualified than Sylvia Earle to give us this assessment of the greatest element of our biosphere."<br>--Hugh Downs</p><p>"An insightful account of the changes Earle has witnessed over the last several decades. Her almost spiritual respect for her subject is evident in her awe-filled writing. . . . At the last, she offers a blueprint for change, with suggestions for guaranteeing the survival of our seas. A must for anyone who shares her deep respect for the life and health of our planet."<br>--<b>NAPRA ReVIEW</b></p><p>"Unlike most people, Ms. Earle has seen nature in its most pristine state, before humans--the newcomers to this environment--have had a chance to interfere. She has seen the alarming consequences of exploitation and greed, and writes of them with a mix of scientific objectivity and a naturalist's passion."<br>--<b>Baltimore Sun</b></p></p><h2>Shaolin Chin Na (English and Chinese Edition)</h2><p>In the Chinese language, chin na roughly translates into two words: &#34;Chin&#34; -to seize, and &#34;na&#34; -to control. Thus, the major purpose of chin na is to quiet or stop an aggressive action without maiming or injuring to a serious extent. As a result, chin na relies on grasping, pressing and unnaturally twisting the sensitive parts of the opponent&#39;s body such as nerves, muscles, and joints.</p><p></p><h2>The Fauve Landscape</h2><p>This text is devoted to the colourful landscapes produced during the Fauvist period of 1904-1908. An essay on the emergence of the Fauve landscape is followed by four essays devoted to individual sites and such topics as Fauvism&#39;s impact on tourism and politics. Another essay concentrates on the critical landscape, in essence the critics&#39; reception of these paintings. Matisse, Braque, Derain, Vlaminck, Dufy, Marquet, Manguin and Friesz are represented with examples of their works.</p><p>This extraordinary book was prepared as a companion to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's exhibit The Fauve Landscape: Matisse, Derain, Braque, and Their Circle, 1904-1908. It is, however, much more than an exhibit catalog. Extensive endnotes following each contributed chapter are as fascinating as the over 400 illustrations (210 in full color) that illuminate the work. Freeman's documentary chronology from 1904 through 1908 draws heavily upon notes and personal correspondence of the Fauve artists and thus provides interesting personal insights. Also notable are reproductions of photographic postcards from the period that document views as the artists would actually have seen them. A selected bibliography and thorough index complete the volume. This will appeal to general readers as well as scholars. Highly recommended for public and academic libraries.<br><i>- P.

Her first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923 when she was 19. Her first work of detective fiction was a serialized story published by the Daily Express in 1927. Entitled The White Cottage Mystery, it contained atypical themes for a woman writer of the era. Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, albeit originally as a minor character. He returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, much taken with the character. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and over 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.</p>Your head may well be aching along with Campion's as thesleuth awakens to find he has amnesia and a looming dread that somemomentous event hangs in the balance that only he can put right. Timeticks along as he becomes buried under more and more incomprehensibleinformation. Unable to recognize even the faithful Lugg or his ownfianc�e, Campion struggles desperately to put the pieces togetherwhile the very fate of England is at stake. A bit on the convolutedand melodramatic side perhaps, but it's all made enjoyable by thesheer breadth of talent brought to bear by narrator FrancisMatthews. It's a pure pleasure to listen to this man talk. He createsa persona for his characters that never slips while moving adroitlyamong various strata of British society. His professional approach tothis material gleans from it every possible bit of entertainment.D.G. � AudioFile 2003, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>When the Monkeys Came Back</h2><p>Years after the jungle in her Costa Rica valley is cut down, Don+a1a Marta persuades her husband to give her a piece of land on which she plants trees that she and descendants care for until they grow into a forest and the monkeys that had once lived there return.</p><p>Ages 5-8. Shrieking, barking, hooting, and howling, the howler monkeys announced the changing of night into day and day into night with a noise "like thunder in the trees." Except for when the monkeys called, the Costa Rican valley where Marta grew up was a quiet, peaceful place. But cars chugged into the valley, followed by men from the city who offered Marta's father lots of money for permission to cut the trees from the mountainside. And when nothing was left of the forest but stumps and brush, the monkeys slipped away. With a piece of land that her husband gives her (even though it goes against custom for women to own land), Marta works to bring back the forest for the monkeys. She plants and tends trees and teaches each of her 11 children, in turn, to do the same. Finally, when Do{�}na Marta is an old woman, her trees touch the sky, and lying awake in bed, she hears again the music that she has missed for 56 long years, the sound of monkeys waking the world. Similar to Virginia Lee Burton's classic The Little House, this story resonates with the rhythms of change, remembering, and restoration, and it will engender in children a wondrous response of recognition. While washes of leaping shadow monkeys haunt the text, Roth's deft illustrations capture the vision of Marta's rain forest valley and her lifelong dream to bring the monkeys back. The illustrator of Levine's Pearl Moscowitz's Last Stand (1993), Roth infuses his watercolors with a lively sense of place and crafts characters with easy-to-read personalities and motivations. Strong in story and vision, this picture book has a grace that will ground it in the hearts of readers and listeners alike. <i>Annie Ayres</i>Grade 1-4-When she was a girl in Costa Rica, Do?a Marta always heard the howler monkeys in the hillside forest announce the coming of day and night. The valley's quiet ways were altered with the arrival of cars, but her father's decision to sell the trees changed the area even more. Within five years, the trees-and the monkeys-had disappeared. Years later, after her father's death, Do?a Marta persuades her husband to let her use the hillside land, and slowly, patiently, she plants and waters her seedlings and, with her children's help, she restores the forest. Franklin's text has a wonderful cadence, with subtle repetitions that underscore the links of present and past. Similarly, Roth's colorful paintings reveal not only the landscape's beauty but also the length of time such projects require. Watercolor silhouettes of a monkey above the blocks of text serve as a constant visual reminder of the woman's motivation. Unlike picture books that offer simple solutions to ecological destruction, Franklin's book reveals the years of hard work required to reverse the results of swift destruction of animal habitats. Over the course of the story, Do?a Marta ages from a girl to a weathered, white-haired but strong woman. That she lives to see the return of the monkeys is a richly deserved and satisfying ending.<br><i>Kathy Piehl, Mankato State University, MN</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>C. S. Lewis: Images of His World</h2><p>This reissue of a treasured classic offers a window into the people and places that shaped the life of beloved author, scholar, and apologist C. S. Lewis. In photographs and text (much of it in Lewis's own words), Douglas Gilbert and Clyde S. Kilby introduce us to such memorable friends as J. R. R. Tolkien and transport us to such magical places as the deer park outside Lewis's rooms at Magdalen College, Oxford. We also meet Lewis as a talented and brilliant child in Belfast, captivated by the myths and legends of the North, already writing and illustrating imaginative stories and poems at a young age.<br>While the book includes an essay tracing Lewis's struggle to find faith and a chronology of his life, it is not a biography per se but rather a personal introduction, a composite portrait of a fascinating individual and the world in which he lived. Attractively laid out in a fresh new format, this volume will be prized both by longtime fans of Lewis and by those encountering him for the first time.</p><p>Clyde S. Kilby served for many years as professor of English and curator of the Marion E. Wade Center, a research collection devoted to the works of C. S. Lewis and his friends, at Wheaton CollegeThis classic 1973 book, re-issued to coincide with Hollywood's attention to C.S. Lewis's Narnia series, offers readers a "personal introduction" to Lewis through photo and text. Kilby, an English professor who died in 1986, was a friend of Lewis's, and strikes an admiring tone in an opening essay on the great writer's spiritual evolution from atheist to Christian. Then Lewis's early life is presented in the usual sepia manner: we see the expected photos from his boyhood in Belfast, but we also glimpse facsimiles of some of the child prodigy's illustrated stories about "Animal-Land." That approach is followed in the rest of the book as well, which is not a simple photo-biography so much as a generous homage to the places Lewis lived and loved. Gilbert's photos-of Magdalen Tower in Oxford, of the pub where the Inklings read their work aloud, of beloved landscapes in England, Ireland, and Scotland-blend with historical images of Lewis and his companions. Although some of Gilbert's own photos of people and urban scenes seem dated, the landscapes are timeless and gorgeous. The book closes with a helpful chronology of Lewis's life. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(This "genetic mishap" is traced to a great-grandmother's secret marriage to a pug.) The doting parents bring up squat, jowly, wrinkly-faced Flix to climb trees and eat fried mice and pickled canaries. Under the tutelage of his basset hound godfather, the pup also learns pride in his canine heritage and masters the dog language. Flix's combined talents win him the respect of both communities, the love of a French exchange-student poodle and eventually a career in politics, in which he campaigns to end cat-dog segregation. Ungerer celebrates the versatility and perspective Flix gains from his mixed ancestry while still acknowledging the hardship of not fitting in. His lively illustrations, which feature highly expressive and individualized faces, are more supple and playful than in earlier books. The accomplished artwork brims with funny touches such as a rat-crossing sign in Cattown (speed up!) and a monument to Laika (the first dog to orbit in space) in Dogtown; more pointed details include the no-dogs-allowed sign in a posh Cattown restaurant. Ungerer's return to the field will be welcomed by all who discover this charming addition to his oeuvre, but will be especially appreciated by children growing up in more than one cultural tradition. Ages 6-10. (May) FYI: Tomi Ungerer's The Three Robbers, Moon Man and No Kiss for Mother are being reissued in paperback, as well as Heidi (by Johanna Spyri) in a hardcover edition. (Roberts Rinehart/Tom!Co, $6.95 40p ages 4-8 ISBN 1-57098-206-6; $6.95 40p ages 4-8 ISBN -207-4; $5.95 40p ages 6-10 ISBN -208-2; $19.95 312p all ages ISBN -162-0; May)<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.It is clear that Ungerer is going for a Picture Book With Meaning. Which means that readers ... need to look at it with as clear and unsentimental an eye as Ungerer himself.... -- <i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Jane Yolen</i><br><br>Surprise! Not only is this the first Tomi Ungerer work for children in 25 years, but it is an uncharacteristically flat and cheerless tale: a two-generation saga about a decidedly bourgeois cat couple, the Kralls, and their incredible offspring, a pug dog named Flix. The reader/viewer follows the mournful-faced pup from baptism and a mostly friendless childhood, (he speaks cat, but with a dog accent) on through his education and eventual marriage to a poodle. When, unexpectedly, Flix launches his own political party-the CDU (Cats and Dogs United), he becomes Lord Mayor of both Cattown and Dog City.<p>But what does it all mean? Certainly Ungerer, an Alsatian by birth and now a resident of Ireland, has first-hand knowledge of the corrosive effects of deep-rooted enmity. But one wonders how many children will last the course of this slow-paced, earnest text that urges us to love one another and live in harmony. Happily, Ungerer's full-color drawings remain as droll and biting as ever. (Note: Ungerer was co-recipient this year of the International Hans Christian Andersen Medal, awarded for the body of his work for children which Parents' Choice also honors.)

Interacting closely with Newbigin&#39;s published and unpublished works, Hunsberger describes Newbigin&#39;s biblical rationale for the life and witness of the church in a culturally plural world. By teasing out Newbigin&#39;s thinking in this realm, Hunsberger gives shape to a theological area of inquiry and reflection badly needed for fruitful discussions of cross-cultural mission, religious pluralism, and ecumenism.</p><p>Hunsberger is professor of missiology at Western Theological Seminary, Holland, Michigan, and coordinator of the Gospel and Our Culture Network.Hunsberger (missiology, Western Theological Seminary) here provides an excellent and comprehensive study of Lesslie Newbigin's "theology of cultural plurality" that examines the Christian gospel in its encounter with concurrent cultures in contemporary life. The work is both theoretical and theological and looks at the meaning of history, the limits of religion, and the calling (election by God) to both conversion and service. Newbigin's theology is a product of his life as a missionary and pastor in India, a teacher of the "theology of mission," and a pastor in an urban English church. Newbigin provides no place for culture bashing or rejection; rather, he teaches that the church must be transformed in a way that is biblically applicable to its particular environment. Newbigin's insights continue to attract the attention of pastors, church leaders, and others who want to understand the application and communication of Christian truth to our world today. Hunsberger has provided extensive references to papers, lectures, and books in this in-depth study.

Her website is www.gailgibbons.comGr. 2-4. One might ask whether there is room for yet another book about wolves. Emphatically, yes--if it is by Gibbons. Using her effective format of large color drawings and a text packed with nuggets of information, the author explores the life of the gray wolf (or timber wolf). She discusses its habitat (which has been greatly decreased over the last several centuries), appearance, hunting, diet, communication systems, social order, reproduction, and relationships with humans. Readers learn that the alpha female is the sole mother in a pack, producing as many as 14 pups. The many kinds of sounds that come from wolves' mouths are not the only means of communication--the placement of their ears and the position of their tails say a lot as well. Lively color illustrations, a mixture of watercolors, pen-and-ink, and colored chalk, follow the wolves on their northern trails throughout the year. This excellent resource for primary-grade students has additional wolf facts, myths, and legends appended. <i>Deborah Abbott</i></p><h2>Safe Haven</h2><p><b>In a small North Carolina town, a mysterious and beautiful woman running from her past slowly falls for a kind-hearted store owner . . . until dark secrets begin to threaten her new life.</b><br>When a mysterious young woman named Katie appears in the small North Carolina town of Southport, her sudden arrival raises questions about her past.

When news comes that Hannah's brother Ben, a soldier, has been captured by the British, Hannah tries to keep busy making candles and helping to rebuild their home. But she can't help worrying about Ben...until suddenly a stranger arrives bringing unexpected news.</p></p><p>Grade 2-5-Hannah Perley's home in Fairfield, CT, has been burned by the British, along with all of the shops and many other houses in the area. Hannah's father is a clockmaker and the family is living in his shop until their house is rebuilt. Her older brother Ben is in the Continental Army. The story details life during this long, cold winter when there is little food and the family finds out that Ben has been taken prisoner by the British. Toward the end of the winter, he is released, and ill and weak, makes his way back home. This final volume in the "Hannah" trilogy gives a realistic glimpse into what life was like during this period. Full-page pencil drawings, spot art, and a map illustrate the volume. Large print, easy vocabulary, and short sentences make this title appropriate for children moving into chapter books, but the story will be of most interest to those who have read the first two books in the series.<br><i>Debbie Feulner, Northwest Middle School, Greensboro, NC </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Graduates of the American Girl series, especially those who have read previous books about Hannah Perley will want to read this third one, in which the 11-year-old struggles with the privations and disruptions of life in the midst of the American Revolution. After the British burn down their home, the six-member Perley family is forced to live in a one-room shed. Their chief misery, however, is the news that the oldest boy, Ben, a colonial soldier, has been captured and is being held aboard a British prison ship riddled with disease. Van Leeuwen is brilliant at showing the effects of war through the prism of one family's life, complete with such homey details as candle dipping and knitting, surprising historical tidbits, and even a recipe for cider cake.

Low GI cuisine produces "only gentle rises in your blood glucose and insulin levels," which supposedly keeps hunger down and energy up. The authors don't produce any studies to back up these claims, but the diet seems reasonable, as it's high in fiber, low in fat and encourages exercise. But the true test of any cookbook is in the kitchen, and based on this criterion, the book is only a qualified success. The recipes are admittedly superior: they're clearly written, with accurate preparation times and scrupulous nutritional information. The wide spectrum of dishes (chickpea burgers, meat and fish entrees, French toast) will appeal to many tastes, and the food is tasty. The problem is a low-GI diet just doesn't seem easy to follow. The authors do include a section on what to keep in your kitchen, as well as a brief passage about food labeling, but it's difficult to imagine how anyone with a job will have time to keep track of all this information. And, although the authors assert that there are "no special foods to buy," it seems unlikely that you'll find quinoa or chermoula at the Piggly-Wiggly.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rix is on the Picture Committee of the Royal Horticultural Society and has been awarded the Gold Veitch Memorial Medal by the Royal Horticultural Society for his services to horticulture. </p><p> The Botanical Garden Volume II: Perennials and Annuals<br> <b>Introduction</b> </p><p> Our aim in this book is to provide new information and a new way of looking at plants and gardening from a more botanical viewpoint. The plant families are covered systematically, and the relationships between them are discussed; readers will be able to put the knowledge they have acquired piecemeal into a framework, and understand the botanical groups and the similarities and differences between them. </p><p> <b>DNA studies in plants</b> </p><p> The discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953 opened up a whole new method for studying the relationships between living things; much more recently, the use of computers to compare large amounts of simple data has revealed new evidence for the ancestry of plants. These new studies have not proved to be a Rosetta Stone that will reveal all, but they have provided some important new information to help solve old problems. Hitherto unsuspected relationships have been suggested, and interesting variations within a single species have also been shown up. The details of the method are complex, but depend on studying the behaviour of three different bodies within the plant cell. The DNA in two of these, the mitochondrion (involved in respiration) and the chloroplast (involved in photosynthesis), is inherited maternally, while the DNA of the third, the nucleus, is derived from both parents. The genes of mitochondria are too unstable to be of use in these studies, but fortunately the genes of chloroplasts are very stable; rearrangements of their DNA sequences are rare enough to be used to indicate major evolutionary groups, but frequent enough to be interesting and worth looking for. Research since the 1980s is now beginning to be used to describe new relationships between genera and families, and new arrangements have been published. These sometimes confirm the classical view based on the morphology of plants, and sometimes bring surprises. </p><p> <b>Major groupings</b> </p><p> The main division of the flowering plants into monocotyledons and dicotyledons is upheld by DNA studies, with the exception of a few primitive plants that fall outside both categories; this indicates that the monocotyledons arose as a group within the primitive dicotyledons, rather than separately. Some of the important groupings of monocotyledons are described below. Within the main body of the dicotyledons, around six groups are shown to be rather isolated. Two of these are the Saxifragales and the Caryophyllales, while two others, the Ranunculales and the Proteales, respectively include the largely herbaceous Ranunculaceae (see pp.38-59), Berberidaceae (see pp.60-63), and Papaveraceae (see pp.64-71), and a diverse group related to <i>Protea</i>, which includes the familiar genera <i>Platanus</i> and <i>Nelumbo</i>: this superficially crazy association of the waterlily-like <i>Nelumbo</i>, the sacred lotus, with totally different-looking trees and shrubs, must rank as one of the great surprises of DNA research. The rest of the main body of dicotyledons fall into two large clades, the Rosids and Asterids, a clade being a group of families or genera with a common ancestor, an evolutionary lineage. The artificiality of several previously recognised families of plants has been shown up by DNA studies. In particular, traditional Scrophulariaceae has been found to be a diverse assemblage, and although the traditional name has been retained here, the plants have been arranged as they naturally fall (see pp.250-63, pp.268-69, and p.277). </p><p> <b>Unanswered questions</b> </p><p> The key question of what the first flowering plant looked like is still unanswered, but we are left with a number of interesting speculations. The modest water plant <i>Ceratophyllum</i> (see p.385), for example, appears to be a very early offshoot from the flowering plant ancestry, but its exact position still remains uncertain; could this be what the first flowering plant was like? </p><p> <b>Hellebore Epimedium, poppy, and Corydalis</b> </p><p> This group of families, which includes the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae (see pp.38-59), was traditionally considered primitive, as many had very simple flowers, with indefinite numbers of separate stamens and carpels. Recent studies have confirmed this, as well as the close relationship of the Berberidaceae (see pp.60-63), which includes several distinct herbaceous genera. Poppies, the Papaveraceae (see pp.64-71), and <i>Corydalis</i>, both of which often have a milky sap, are related to this group. The beautiful Japanese <i>Glaucidium</i>, which was of doubtful affinity, has been shown to fall within Ranunculaeae, but the rather similar <i>Paeonia</i> is now thought to be closer to Saxifragaceae (see pp.98-108). </p><p> <b>Dianthus, cactus, polygonum, and mesembryanthemum</b> </p><p> Pinks and carnations, <i>Dianthus</i>, and <i>Silene</i> are the main garden genera of their family, the Caryophyllaceae (see pp.74-81); several garden weeds from this family, such as chickweed and mouse-ear chickweed, are almost universal. Related to this group are the mainly succulent families Cactaceae (see p.87), which is so characteristic of the American deserts, and the Aizoaceae or Mesembryanthemaceae (see p.86), which takes its place in southern Africa; both of these families have an unusual metabolism that enables them to withstand extreme drought conditions. Other families of this group, the Caryophyllaies, are edible and furnish such vegetables as beet, spinach, and rhubarb, and such diverse ornamentals as <i>Limonium</i>, <i>Mirabilis</i>, <i>Drosera</i>, and <i>Tamarix</i>. </p><p> <b>Saxifrage, Sedum, and peony</b> </p><p> The group called Saxifragales, as identified by DNA studies, is unusually diverse. The Saxifragaceae (see pp.98-108), many of which are mountain plants, are close to the usually succulent Crassulaceae (see p.109), which includes <i>Sedum</i>, the stonecrop. <i>Paeonia</i>, a remarkably isolated genus, whose affinities have long been in dispute, probably belongs here, although here Paeonlaceae (see pp.58-59) is listed in its traditional position next to Ranunculaceae; it appears to be closest to <i>Daphniphyllum</i>. The woody plants (see Volume I) traditionally placed in Hamamelidaceae, such as <i>Liquidambar</i>, <i>Cercidiphyllum</i>, and <i>Itea</i>, are now thought to belong here, as does <i>Ribes</i>, the gooseberry and currant. </p><p> <b>Geranium and Francoa</b> </p><p> The important horticultural family Geraniaceae (see pp. 112-15) includes the hardy <i>Geranium</i>, found all over the world, and the tender <i>Pelargonium</i>, which is mainly South African. Both of these genera have a large number of species with attractive characteristics, such as scented leaves and brightly coloured flowers, as well as large seeds that are dispersed far from the parent plant, by a spring in the case of <i>Geranium</i> (or rarely as a burr), or by wind, with a silky tall, in the case of <i>Pelargonium</i>. DNA indicates that the southern hemisphere plants <i>Melianthus</i> and <i>Francoa</i> are related to <i>Geranium</i>. </p><p> <b>Sarracenia, Primula, Phlox, and Impatiens</b> </p><p> The family Primulaceae (see pp.198-205), though small in number of genera, is important in temperate gardens, mainly because <i>Primula</i> itself has undergone such an explosion of beautiful species in the Himalayas and the Alps. The family also includes <i>Anagallis</i> and <i>Lysimachia</i>. Closely related to <i>Primula</i> is the mainly American <i>Phlox</i>, <i>Polemonium</i>, and the climbing <i>Cobaea</i>, in the Polemoniaceae (see pp.196-97). These are shown by DNA studies to fall within the Asterids, and within that to belong to the Ericales, a large group that includes <i>Impatiens</i> and the pitcher plants <i>Sarracenia</i>, as well as shrubs such as <i>Styrax</i>, <i>Camellia</i>, and <i>Rhododendron</i> (see Volume I). </p><p> <b>Peas, beans, Lathyrus, and Polygala</b> </p><p> Peas, beans, and vetches, in the family Leguminosae (see pp.124-37), are shown to be a distinct group within th</p></p><h2>Batman &amp; Robin by Tomasi &amp; Gleason Omnibus</h2><p><b>Damian Wayne, the secret child of Bruce Wayne (Batman) and his sworn enemy, Talia al Ghul, was trained from birth to kill and raised to rule the world.

Over the course of three years, journalist Thomas Laird spent more than sixty hours with His Holiness the Dalai Lama in candid, one-on-one interviews that covered His Holiness&#x2019;s beliefs on history, science, reincarnation, and his lifelong study of Buddhism. Traveling across great distances to offer vivid descriptions of Tibet&#x2019;s greatest monasteries, Laird brings his meetings with His Holiness to life in a rich and vibrant historical narrative that outlines the essence of thousands of years of civilization, myth, and spirituality. His Holiness introduces us to Tibet&#x2019;s greatest yogis and meditation masters, and explains how the institution of the Dalai Lama was founded. Embedded throughout this journey is His Holiness&#x2019;s lessons on the larger roles religion and spirituality have played in Tibet&#x2019;s story, reflecting the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s belief that history should be examined not only conventionally but holistically. <i>The Story of Tibet</i> is His Holiness&#x2019;s personal look at his country&#x2019;s past as well as a summation of his life&#x2019;s work as both spiritual and temporal leader of the Tibetan people.</p><p>Thomas Laird has been based in Kathmandu, Nepal for thirty years and now divides his time between there and New Orleans.

Will deepen general readers' knowledge of Tibet, its religion, and its engaging leader."<br><br>"A tenderly crafted study that is equal parts love letter, traditional history, and oral history . . . Throughout, Laird's colorful and lively writing brings to life thousands of years of Tibetan history, inviting the reader on his journey to a strange and wonderful land."<br><br>"This book presents a much wider range of material than we are accustomed to hearing discussed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Journalist Thomas Laird Includes valuable background information throughout, lending valuable support to their conversations; but it is the Dalai Lama's mastery of a wealth of historical information that makes this captivating reading."<br><br>"The Fourteenth Dalai Lama's fresh account of Tibetan myth and history, as shared at Dharamsala over a three-year period with Thomas Laird, is wonderful instruction and a great true pleasure, not less to because of the small informal moments that clarify these encounters with that delightful Buddha being who manifests in the beleaguered public figure of His Holiness."<br><br>"Thomas Laird's lively conversations with His Holiness the Dalal Lama and the history and mythology of Tibet couldn't come at a better moment, as China stubbornly persists in negating the distinctive Tibetan identity. The honesty, subtlety, and complexlty of His Holiness's thoughts of these crucial matters comes through in these fascinating dialogues. Everyone who cares about Tibet, or about a stable peace in Asia, should read this amazing account."</p><h2>The First Wave: The D-Day Warriors Who Led the Way to Victory in World War II</h2><p><b><b>A NATIONAL BESTSELLER<br><br>The&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Liberator</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Avenue of Spies</i>&nbsp;returns with an utterly immersive, adrenaline-driven account of D-Day combat.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Meet the assaulters: pathfinders plunging from the black, coxswains plowing the whitecaps, bareknuckle Rangers scaling sheer rock . . .

For this book he extended his search for folk traditions to one of the most heavily industrialized sections of the United States. Can folklore be found, he wondered, in the Calumet Region of northwest Indiana? Does it exist among the steelworkers, ethnic groups, and blacks in Gary, Whiting, East Chicago, and Hammond? </p><p> In his usual entertaining style, Dorson shows that a rich and varied folklore exists in the Region. Although it differs from that of rural people, it is equally vital. Much of this urban lore finds expression in conversational anecdotes and stories that deal with pressing issues: the flight from the inner city, crime in the streets, working conditions in the steel mills, the maintenance of ethnic identity, the place of blacks in a predominantly white society. The folklore reveals strongly held attitudes such as the loathing of industrial work, resistance to assimilation, and black adoption of middle-class-white values. </p><p> Miliworkers and mill executives, housewives, ethnic performers, storekeepers, and preachers tell their stories about the Region. The concerns that occupy them affect city dwellers throughout the United States. <i>Land of the Millrats</i>, though it depicts a special place, speaks for much of America. </p></p><p>Richard M.

A stockbroker himself, Brendan leans back and tweaks his fireman's suspenders in obvious pleasure at the laughter he has elicited.&nbsp;&nbsp;One's first impressions are that he is a man of insatiable if not unquenchable appetites, who is gifted at lowering his own and others' anxieties through comic self-mockery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in the next couple of minutes, Brendan reels off his unsuccessful battles in the pasta wars, his medical woes, his doctor's warnings, in so entertaining a fashion that we are all reduced to giggles and guffaws by someone who is telling us he could keel over any day now.<br><br>Brendan would be a hard act to follow for anyone, but perhaps more so for Mary, the homemaker turned nurse after the last of her four children left for college.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden inside a drab dress purchased joylessly from a catalogue that specializes in euphemistic names for obesity, Mary looks as if she'd give anything for a place to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;When she speaks, it is in the hushed voice of a penitent making confession.&nbsp;&nbsp;She lists the years of eating "sins" that have turned her into the "fatty," as she puts it, that we see today.&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentions that most of her overeating has occurred at night, after taking care of her kids and husband, and more recently, of the patients on her hospital shift.&nbsp;&nbsp;She says that food has been her reward, but that her "just desserts" are causing her, among other things, sore joints.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wistfully, she notes that she is no longer able to join her husband in hiking and other outdoor activities they used to enjoy together.<br><br>Others share their own short stories, all of which revolve around food and their problematic relationship with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all their differences, these people share much more in common than excess pounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all bright.&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't need to be told that a cup of broccoli has fewer calories than a cup of H�agen-Dazs.<br><br>They may talk about the temptations of leftovers, about jobs that require lots of dining out, of sweet tooths or problems around the holidays, but on some level they also know it's about none of these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fern will understandably make no reference today to her mother's expectations, Brendan to his father's beatings, or Mary to the woman's name and phone number she found last week scribbled on a piece of paper in her husband's trousers.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will talk only about food.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will actually identify themselves as compulsive eaters.<br><br>Perhaps most important, the people sitting around this table today, like the hundreds who have come before them, are fellow travelers on the dieting roller coaster, people whose losing battles have filled them not only with excess pounds but with shame, inadequacy, and self-loathing.&nbsp;&nbsp;They, like you, may not be able to articulate it, but religious or not, they are here in a desperate attempt to save their souls.<br><br>If you've picked up this book and have read this far, chances are you know all too well that for most people, including yourself, diets don't work! You have tried different programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have read through what seem like a zillion books and magazines about weight, and have ended up at best confused and discouraged, at worst resigned.&nbsp;&nbsp;One magazine tells you to count fat grams and avoid carbohydrates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another tells you to eat all the chocolate you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;A miracle drug promises to help you drop ten pounds in a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest gastronomical guru says the whole secret is combining Food A with Food B.<br><br><i>And none of it works!</i> None of it works because, for compulsive eaters, nutritional information, good, bad, or indifferent, is irrelevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;You already know that if you take in more calories than you expend, you will gain weight, and vice versa.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know how to count calories when you want to count calories.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do you know that exercise is good for you, but you could probably determine without too much difficulty how walking a mile at a twenty-minute pace compares calorically with fifteen minutes on a Stairmaster at Level 3.<br><br>All this information is, I repeat, irrelevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;For compulsive eaters, the problem is not lack of information about food or exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Food is not the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue, as you are all too well aware, is the repetitive nature of your compulsive behavior, or what I call your <i>life script,</i> when it comes to the interplay of food and feelings.<br><br>What you don't understand is why or how.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Why</i> you are stuck in compulsive behaviors that make you unable to eat the way you imagine "normal" people do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>How</i> to get out of this emotional quagmire.<br><br>In a world filled with psychobabble, it's easy for the meaning of words to be lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me be clear from the outset about what I mean when I refer to compulsive eating.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I use that term, I am talking about any kind of non-hunger-related eating acted out in a repetitive fashion that leads to negative physical and emotional consequences.<br><br>Compulsive eating has been compared with sharks on a feeding frenzy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just listen to the words I've heard my workshop participants use to describe their binges:<br><br>"I shoveled the gallon of ice cream into my mouth so quickly that I barely gave myself a chance to breathe.&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was over, I retreated into my bedroom, overwhelmed with feelings of shame."<br><br>"I stared at the television set, transfixed like a zombie.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like I was in a trance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was completely unaware of what my hands were doing or of the mounting pile of candy wrappers at my feet."<br><br>"From the time I entered the supermarket--actually from some point earlier than that--it was as though I had entered, or was pulled, into this strange zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;It felt almost like a gravitational force was drawing me into its orbit and that I was heading for oblivion."<br><br>Recognize yourself?<br><br>When a compulsive eater enters the "trance state" that precedes and accompanies an eating binge, an encyclopedia of nutritional information will turn to instant mush.&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling a compulsive eater that finishing off the key lime pie in the refrigerator will result in so many calories is like telling someone in the middle of a sex act that without percautions, pregnancy or disease might result.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chances are the person has not gotten to this point because of an educational deficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;How many of you reading this, for example, are thinking, "If only someone had told me that the five slices of pizza with sausages I devoured last night had more calories than what I used up during the half hour it took me to eat them while watching that rerun of Mary Tyler Moore?"<br><br>It's knowing the answers and not acting on them that makes you feel so desperate!<br><br>It doesn't have to be that way.<br><br>If the tone of this book is confident, it is because I have witnessed success with people who have struggled most of their lives with food, eating, and weight issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;When they come to my workshop, they finally feel they have found something that is taking them in the right direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also confident because the journey you are about to embark upon is guided by some of the most contemporary research and thinking in the treatment of compulsive eating.&nbsp;&nbsp;But before we set out, a friendly word of warning: If your focus is simply on quick weight loss, this is not the book for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, as I've said, tons of programs and printed material giving you new diets every year.<br><br>On the other hand, although this book will not spell out a diet plan for you or treat the symptom that is your excess weight, your body invariably will begin to normalize as you begin to make the emotional changes that lie at the heart of <b>The Hunger Within</b>.<br><br>Most important, this is not simply a book.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an interactive workbook designed exclusively for compulsive eaters.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is filled with exercises and information that will help you explore and subdue the forces driving your eating patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;This workbook will serve as a road

Roosevelt. It is rather a critical account of that episode in American politics known as the New Deal. As to the President, it is an account of an image projected upon the popular mind which came to be known as Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is the author&#39;s conviction that this image did not at all correspond to the man himself and that it is now time to correct the lineaments of this synthetic figure created by highly intelligent propaganda, aided by mass illusion and finally enlarged and elaborated out of all reason by the fierce moral and mental disturbances of the war. The purpose of this book, therefore, is to present the Franklin D. Roosevelt of the years 1932 to 1945 in his normal dimensions, reduced in size to agree with reality. The war played havoc with history-writing after 1940. Not only did a great curtain of secrecy come down upon performers in the drama of the war, but their portraits and their actions were presented to us through the movies, the radio and the press upon a heroic scale as part of the business of selling the warriors and the statesmen and the war to the people. Their blunders and their quarrels were blotted out of the picture. Only the bright features were left. The casual citizen saw them as exalted beings moving in glory across the vast stage of war, uttering eloquent appeals to the nation, challenging the enemy in flaming words, striding like heroes and talking like gods. The moment has come when the costumes, the grease paint, the falsely colored scenery, the technicolored spotlights and all the other artifices of make-up should be put aside and, in the interest of truth, the solid facts about the play and the players revealed to the people. A whole 20-foot shelf of books has appeared glorifying the character and career of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In addition a large number of men and women who were associated with his administrations have published their own versions of their several parts in those administrations. And while these contain some incidental criticisms, the chief effect of all these books is to feed the legend of the world conqueror and remodeler. Curiously, only two or three critical works have appeared and these touch only special sectors of the whole story. It seemed to me there was room for at least one critical book covering the whole period of Roosevelt&#39;s terms as President. There is much to this story with which I have not attempted to deal either because it is not provable or, if provable, is not yet believable or because it belongs to a domain of writing for which I have neither taste nor experience. I have omitted any account of the bitter struggle which attended our entry into the war or any attempt to determine whether or not we should have gone into the war. That is another story which is reserved for a later day. Similarly no account of the military conduct of the war is included. The facts about that are even more obscure than the political facts and must await the release of a mass of documents still under official lock and key. I have, however, sought to clear up from the recently offered testimony of the chief actors, the diplomatic performances in that shocking and pathetic failure during and after the war. And I have included some account of the incredible mismanagement of our economic scene at home during the war. I have limited myself severely to facts. A critic may disagree with my interpretation of those facts, but he will not be able successfully to contradict them. I have introduced into the text numbered references to my authorities and these appear at the end of the book. The facts are drawn from official records and reports, the testimony given in congressional investigations, the reports of responsible journalists and a large number of books by men who were actors in these scenes.</p><p>from the Foreword by John T.

The book fills in the details of what exactly FDR did that subverted the Constitution. Examples: His administration told the public that the free enterprise system couldn't produce enough to feed America at even a bare subsistence level-then proceeded to spend $700 million over a two year period to destroy crops and livestock to raise agricultural prices. He oversaw the creation of the National Industrial Recovery Association, which organized various industries into collectives free to fix prices and arrest those who didn't go along (in one instance, a tailor was arrested for charging 35 cents to hem a pair of pants instead of the guild mandated minimum of 40 cents). FDR got around the legislative process of lawmaking by creating agencies which then received appropriations without Congressional approval; these agencies then created their own regulations and enforcement branches. FDR created dozens of "social welfare" programs which he himself admitted were "narcotic." And despite the popular perception that FDR "ended the depression" there were just as many people unemployed and just as many people on the dole in 1939 as there were in 1932 when FDR was first elected. In short, FDR was skilled at getting elected, but not at leading (anyone could get elected 4 times if they stood on the street giving away $100 bills; the catch is that FDR didn't tell the public that their children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, etc. would be the ones paying for it). And of course there was FDR's biggest debacle: the Social Security program, the biggest pyramid scheme of all time. It's important to note that this book was written by a contemporary of FDR and not by some publicity hound. John T. Flynn had been a respected writer for years before he wrote this book and has also written other important books. WARNING: Because of the decades long propaganda by the mass media, there are many who place FDR in equal esteem with Jesus Christ. Be prepared for temper tantrums, emotional outbursts, and insults directed at you if you discuss this book. --By A Customer<br><br>"The American politician, without troubling his pragmatic mind with the meaning of words, has discovered socialism- and embraced it- not as a great system of social organization, but as a wondrous machine for the purpose of buying votes." - John T. Flynn As John T. Flynn explains, Americans generally tend to see FDR as a "noble, gentle, selfless, hard-headed, wise and farseeing combination of philosopher, philanthropist and warrior" who "performed some amazing feat of regeneration for this country". They perceive him as the providential knight in shining armour who saved America from that evil spawn of unbridled capitalism, the Great Depression, and the world itself from that dark and alien evil from Europe, nazism. I for one never fell for the Roosevelt myth. By the time I knew what he did, I had enough moral, political and economic common sense not to feel the slightest admiration for him. To be frank, I have always considered him the worst American president ever. So when I started Flynn's *The Roosevelt Myth*, I did not expect to have any illusions of mine destroyed. The book did change my perception of Roosevelt though. I had always assumed he had been some evil genius who destroyed the Constitutional basis of freedom in America in a conscious, calculating and utterly insidious way. I saw him as some malignant mastermind who had thoroughly bluffed a gullible American citizenry and robbed them of liberties which they were too unintellectual (or, alternatively, too intellectually corrupt) really to understand and cherish. In other words, I perceived Roosevelt as an Ellsworth Toohey, when he was closer to a James Taggart. True, Roosevelt was a power luster. As Flynn explains, he was a pure politician, if you define politics as the art of winning votes. But this is all he was. In this lay all his intelligence. In all other matters, except perhaps maritime history, he was just a snobbish dilettante, completely unread and devoid of curiosity. His knowlege of economics and political science was "a total blank". He was nothing but a small, shallow man whose na�vet�, ignorance, overconfidence in his own charm and complete lack of principles made him a mere puppet in the hands of the reds and pinks who swarmed in his office or interacted with him on the international scene. That he was corrupt to the bone, there is no doubt: he was corrupt to a degree I thought had only characterized the White House since the Kennedy administration. But he was politically evil only by default, because of his ineffectiveness, his blindness, his vanity, his fatuousness, his lust for power and public adulation. All the evil I saw in him while studying his speeches did not originate in him, for they were all ghostwritten: he was only lending his "golden voice" to the string pullers in his administration, the actual "thinkers" of the New Deal, the genuine Tooheys. *The Roosevelt Myth* is not a well-structured book. It is not chronological, it does tend to repeat itself, and it may be a bit confusing for someone who is not familiar with the broad outlines of the New Deal to begin with, as it is very detailed and swarms --By Jean-Francois Virey<br><br>I finished this incredible book thinking I should have read it decades ago. But I'll return to it again soon. 'The Roosevelt Myth' is a book that will, I am sure, massively repay repeated readings. In this book, journalist John T. Flynn takes a buzzsaw to one of America's most unjustly inflated reputations. It's hard to describe how incredibly comprehensive his book is. The New Deal -- in all its fraudulent incarnations -- is analyzed, as are FDR's decisions to run for a third, and then a fourth, term. The ways socialists, communists, and other pinkos (Flynn's term) infiltrated ... no, flooded ... into the Roosevelt Administration and used it for their own purposes in war and peace are made shockingly clear, as is the way America' war propaganda system was used to promote Joe Stalin and slander and smear American anti-communists. The way FDR's wife and children used his name to make themselves rich is also thoroughly explored, as is the growth of the Regulatory State, a Roosevelt invention, as a tool of political, economic, and social control. In my Amazon.com review of Thomas Fleming's 'The New Dealers' War: FDR and the War Within World War II' (Basic Books: 2001), I said that it sometimes seemed FDR viewed the New Deal more as an electoral ploy than an ideological commitment. Flynn makes it clear (I wish I'd read this book before Fleming's) that there's no 'seemed' about it: the New Deal *never was anything but* an electoral ploy. The New Deal Roosevelt campaigned on in 1932 was jettisoned before he even entered office. The one he introduced in the First Hundred Days had a different philosophical foundation, different programs, and different goals. The so-called 'Third New Deal,' several years later, was yet again different from the two that preceded it. In short, the New Deal was a political bait-and-switch operation from the very beginning. The reason the New Deal wasn't ideological, Flynn argues again and again, is that FDR himself was a man with no fundamental philosophy of government, no understanding of economics or finance, and no objective beyond maximizing the votes he would receive at the next election. He stumbled from policy to policy, and crisis to crisis, looking only for ways to gain political advantage. (Flynn makes it clear, for example, that FDR deliberately refused to work with the lame-duck President Hoover to mitigate the effects of the Depression in the winter of 1932-33. FDR wanted to make sure the crisis got as bad as possible, so Republicans would be demonized and himself celebrated as the man who single-handedly turned the economy around. Years later, as the Depression got even worse, FDR seriously considered throwing the 1940 election so the GOP would be in the White House when the economy hit bottom a second time. Then, he and the Democrats would ride to the rescue again in 1944. The onset of World War II in Europe convinced him to scrap this idea and run for a third term immediately.) 'The Roosevelt Myth' has a great deal of application for the twenty-first century reader. For example, 'Any unfavorable turn [Roosevelt] attributed to a secret plot of his enemies. Any criticism of his measures he put down to some secret hatred of him personally' [Book 2, chapter 3]. Or, 'Mrs Roosevelt's long residence in the White House and the long indulgence of the people toward numerous journeys by the family across the borderline of good conduct had badly confused her sense of the proprieties. The unwritten law for Presidents and their families is that they shall be more meticulous than any in the observance of the ethical and social restraints enforced upon the population in times of stress. But Mrs Roosevelt felt that her position in the White House entitled her to an exemption from these restraints' [Book 3, chapter 2]. --By Andrew S.

To sort through her grief, one of his daughters, Sarah, decides to write a biography of her internationally celebrated father.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within hours of beginning her research, Sarah comes across the first of what will be many shocking revelations. As her life is slowly torn apart, a terrible logic finally emerges to explain her mother's remoteness, her father's need to continually reinvent himself in his work, and a long-forgotten London murder.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Writing as Ruth Rendell, Barbara Vine has earned the Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement. In <i>The Chimney Sweeper's Boy</i>, Vine proves herself the equal of her alter ego and a master of the psychological thriller--as well as the police procedural--in this riveting novel. Why bestselling novelist Gerald Candless assumed a new identity years before his marriage and the birth of his two daughters isn't revealed until the penultimate chapter of the book, but the effect of his deception on his family drives Vine's deft character studies. In Gerald's wife, Ursula, and his daughters, Hope and Sarah, Vine has created three complex women in the thrall of an equally complicated and compelling man. As Sarah unravels the mystery of her father's deception, Gerald gradually becomes a more sympathetic figure.

It would end officially almost five years later. Unofficially, it has never ended: the horrors we live with today were born in the First World War.<br><br>It left millions--civilians and soldiers--maimed or dead. And it left us with new technologies of death: tanks, planes and submarines; reliable rapid-fire machine guns and field artillery, poison gas and chemical warfare. It introduced us to U-boat packs and strategic bombing, to unrestricted war on civilians and maltreatment of prisoners. most of all, it changed our world. In its wake, empires toppled, monarchies fell, whole populations lost their national identities as political systems and geographic boundaries realigned. Instabilities were institutionalized, enmities enshrined. And the social order shifted seismically. Manners, mores, codes of behavior; literature and the arts; education and class distinctions--all underwent a vast sea change. In all these ways, the twentieth century can be said to have been born on the morning of June 28, 1914. <br></p><p>One of Britain's most distinguished historians, Martin Gilbert was knighted in 1995. A fellow of Merton College, Oxford, he is also the official biographer of Winston Churchill. Among his books are <i>The Holocaust, The Second World War, Churchill: A Life, Auschwitz and the Allies, The First World War</i>, and <i>Never Again.</i> <br>There may be no event in this century that has been more written about than the First World War. There may be little new to uncover about it. But this splendid book shows that its lessons cannot be too often learned. This is by no means a complete history. Whole areas of the conflict are scanted or mentioned only in passing, in particular the war on the Eastern Front. Distinguished British historian Gilbert (The Second World War, 1989, etc.) gives a great deal of attention to the British, less to the French, and a good deal less to everyone else. Nor is he particularly interested in strategy. But the power and passion that he brings to the story, the vividness with which he recreates the scale of the conflict, the enormity of its suffering, feats of individual bravery and cowardice, of devotion and desertion, will be hard to emulate. What lingers in the mind is the sheer scale of the suffering. In the first five weeks of conflict at Verdun, German soldiers were killed at the rate of one every 45 seconds, and French death rates were even higher. In the five months during which the battles of Verdun and the Somme were waged in 1916, nearly a million men died, an average of 6,600 every day, more than 277 every minute, nearly 5 every second. This was not exceptional: As Gilbert points out, the 20,000 British soldiers killed on the first day of the Somme are often recalled with horror, yet on average, a similar number of soldiers died during every four-day period of the entire war. His searing descriptions of the carnage poignantly remind us of the terrible consequences that followed from the casualness with which European statesmen allowed their nations to drift into war. An incomparable record of how ordinary and extraordinary men and women endured the unendurable. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But until you can measure their likenesses and differences you can have no science of odor.<br><br>--ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL, 1914<br><br>No satisfactory classification of odours can be given.<br><br>--Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911<br><br>How many smells are there? It's an odd question, but give it some thought. Mentally flip through the pages of your personal smell catalog. You find burnt toast, shaving cream, Grandma's kitchen, and pine trees. There's the weird glue in the binding of that pocket-size Latin/English dictionary from high school. With a little effort you can come up with a lot of smells, but putting a number to them is difficult. How does one count the odors of a lifetime, much less all the odors in the world?<br><br>Some people aren't daunted by the task: they simply estimate. Better yet, they pass along estimates made by others. Journalists like to say that we can smell thirty thousand different odors. The New Age guru Michael Murphy cites this figure in The Future of the Body (1992): "According to the calculations of one [fragrance] manufacturer, an expert can distinguish more than 30,000 nuances of scent." Murphy, in turn, got the number from Vitus Droscher, a German pop science writer (1969): "A perfume manufacturer has worked out that a real expert must distinguish at least thirty thousand nuances of scent." Droscher doesn't provide a source. Perhaps it was in Science Digest (1966): "Industrial chemists have identified some 30,000 different smells." Unfortunately, the magazine didn't provide a source either. What this proves, I suppose, is that dubious facts thrived in the media long before the Internet.<br><br>One would like to think that smell scientists have a better grasp of the matter, and indeed they prefer to quote a different estimate. When Linda Buck and Richard Axel won the 2004 Nobel Prize for discovering the olfactory receptors, the Nobel Foundation issued a press release. It noted that people recognize and remember "about 10,000 different odours," a figure the Swedish publicists took from the prize winners themselves. Surely that's a number we can take to the bank. But the number 10,000 didn't originate with Buck and Axel: it had been tossed about for years by other scientists. Something about it had always bothered me--why such a nice fat round number? Why was there no date of discovery? And, strangest of all, why did nobody take credit for it?<br><br>If you try to track down the mysterious number 10,000 to its original source in the scientific literature, you are in for an adventure; like walking a maze, dead ends abound. For example, I began with a paper in Behavioral Ecology (2001), which I followed to another in Trends in Genetics (1999), which in turn didn't provide a source. I started again, this time with a prominent smell researcher, the Brown University psychologist Trygg Engen. In 1982 he wrote, "Some have claimed that an untrained person can identify by label at least 2,000 odors and an expert can identify as many as 10,000." Engen credits this claim to R. H. Wright, Canada's most famous smell scientist. Wright seemed a likely source, at least until I read what he actually wrote, back in 1964: "[I]t seems likely that the average person would have no trouble in distinguishing between several thousand odours, and an experienced authority in the field has claimed the ability to recognize well over ten thousand. Still another has simply said the number is apparently unlimited." Wright goes on to say, "It would be an interesting exercise to design an experiment to verify these estimates." Ooof! So Wright didn't discover any number at all--he just passed along what he had heard and Professor Engen repeated it. These eminent smell experts remind me of kids at summer camp passing along ghost stories.<br><br>I was beginning to think I'd never find the source of the magic number 10,000, when I found it once more in a 1999 food chemistry textbook. From there I followed it to a 1966 paper, and then to a paper published in 1954 by researchers from the Arthur D. Little, Inc., consulting company. At a scientific conference the previous year, the Little folks presented a paper titled "An information theory of olfaction." Their goal was to place numerical limits on odor perception. They said "There are experts who affirm that it is possible to recognize at least 10,000 odors," a figure they used in their mathematical subsequent analysis. The name of their expert was buried in a footnote: he was Ernest C. Crocker, a chemical engineer and 1914 MIT graduate who, not coincidently, was also an employee of Arthur D. Little, Inc.<br><br>Back in 1927, Crocker and another Little chemist named Lloyd F. Henderson were struggling for an objective way to classify odors. They settled on a method in which an odor was rated by how strongly (on a scale of 0 to 8) it resembled each of four elementary odor sensations. Given the mathematics of their rating system, it was theoretically possible to discriminate 94 or 6,561 different odors. The math is watertight, but the outcome is highly dependent on the initial assumptions. Had Crocker and Henderson used, say, five elementary sensations and a 0-to-10 rating scale, the estimate would have been 115 or 161,051 different odors. (Harvard psychologist Edwin Boring was a fan of the new system, but he believed the rating scale should have fewer steps. He did some calculations and decided that the number of distinguishable smells was somewhere between 2,016 and 4,410.) Discussing this work years later, Ernest Crocker generously rounded up the estimate to 10,000 odors. His colleagues took the number and ran with it.<br><br>In the end, it appears that no one has ever attempted to count how many smells there are in the world. Estimates of odor diversity lead either to a dead end or to Ernest C. Crocker. The comfortable, often-cited figure of 10,000 smells is, from a scientific perspective, utterly worthless.<br><br>Why does it matter exactly how many smells there are? Suppose we want to build a device that can reproduce every possible odor. (This is a popular fantasy. As a kid you may have scratch-and-sniffed your way through Mickey Mouse and the Marvelous Smell Machine.) A pair of industrial engineers once looked into how many distinct odors it would take to create a lifelike smellscape in virtual reality. They settled on a figure of 400,000. (This number has no more basis in fact than 10,000 or 30,000; its ultimate source is an obscure Japanese technical publication). Four hundred thousand is a staggeringly large number, but it sounds reasonable to engineers who use 16.7 million colors per pixel in visual displays for VR goggles. The trouble is that an engineer's solution doesn't always correspond to how the brain solves the problem.<br><br>The human eye detects tiny differences in color; across the visible spectrum we are capable of millions of such discriminations. Yet when it comes to naming categories of color, there is nearly universal agreement that only a half-dozen are needed to cover the range of human perception. People in all cultures get by very well with white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue. (Esoteric hues such as ecru and mauve occur mainly in clothing catalogs.) The physical spectrum of visible light is continuous; the stripes of the rainbow are created in our head. We give color names to these few categories.<br><br>This simplification of sensory input is a general feature of the brain, a phenomenon psychologists call categorical perception. In hearing, categorical perception helps us carve the continuous dimension of pitch into the individual notes of the musical scale, or the sonic blur of vowel sounds into a distinct a or e. Perhaps we shouldn't obsess about the number of odors. Our question should be, How many natural odor categories are there, and how do our nose and brain simplify the world?<br><br>The Art of the Achievable<br><br>I grew up in Davis, California, amid the smells of agriculture. Our house, when we first moved there in 1962, was near vast tomato fields; walking through them brought up the sharp, funky smell of the vines. The approach of a new school year was signaled by the heavy, stewed smell of tomatoes being cooked into ketchup at the Hunt-Wesson plant a mile upwind. My buddies and I played on mountains of newly baled alfalfa, stacked high and smelling grassy-sweet. The playground at the Valley Oak Elementary School offered the hot-metal smell of monkey bars and the dusty, sour resin of tanbark underfoot. The water from the sprinklers in the town park had a musty tinge to it. The office of the Davis Enterprise, where I rolled copies for my afternoon paper route, was saturated with the smell of fresh ink, newsprint, and rubber bands. In grade school my class toured the Spreckles refinery, where truckloads of sugar beets were turned into pure white sugar, a magical transformation dimmed by the suffocating scent of dark molasses that hung over the place.<br><br>We moved to Davis because my father joined the faculty of the philosophy department at the university there. Davis was originally the agricultural field station for the main university campus at Berkeley. Set in the hot, flat, and fertile Sacramento Valley, but near the cooler hills of Napa and Sonoma, UC Davis came into its own in the 1960s, when it added a law school and a medical school. At the same time, researchers in the Department of Viticulture and Enology got the ball rolling for what became the California wine-making revolution. They measured microclimates and soil composition, developed new grape varieties, and invented cold fermentation and other wine production techniques. Davis graduates who took courses in wine tasting and wine-making are now among the world's leading vintners. As part of this effort, UCD researchers took up the sensory analysis of wine. Their challenge was to apply objective methods to one of the more rarefied arenas of subjective opinion: wine tasting.<br><br>One of this group was Professor Ann Noble, a chemist and sensory specialist. Among her interests was identifying volatile chemical compounds in wine. These substances create the characteristic aroma of grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Riesling, and also the off-odors found in poorly made wines. Noble hoped to link aroma chemistry to broader grape-growing and wine-making factors.<br><br>Noble's approach to aroma was practical and effective. Not for her the pretensions of the wine snob, epitomized by Paul Giamatti's character in the movie Sideways, who sticks his nose in a wineglass and says, "I'm getting strawberries, some citrus . . . passionfruit, just the faintest soupcon of asparagus, and, like, a nutty Edam cheese." To better understand California Cabernets, Noble and her colleague Hildegard Heymann selected wines from seven regions around the state (Napa, Sonoma, Alexander Valley, Santa Ynez, etc.). The wines were rated by enology students who came up with their own simple descriptive terms: berry, bell pepper, eucalyptus, and so on. Reference samples were created by doctoring a neutral "base" wine. To represent berry, for example, one-half teaspoon of raspberry jam and one half of a frozen blackberry were added to a half-cup of wine; after soaking for ten minutes, the blackberry was removed. For the soy/prune standard, the basic wine was spiked with a quarter-cup of canned prune juice and seventeen drops of Kikkoman soy sauce.<br><br>Armed only with their noses and a nine-point rating scale, the students sniffed and sipped their way to an enormous pile of data. (It filled a metaphorical filing cabinet thirteen descriptors wide, twenty-one Cabernets tall, and thirteen judges deep.) With a computer program, Noble and Heymann extracted a small number of sensory dimensions and placed each wine at a precise location on them. They could now visualize the smell and taste relationships between the samples. Their conclusions: "Younger vines and/or vines from cooler areas tend to produce more intensely vegetative wines. Conversely, wines from older vines and/or warmer areas tend to have higher ratings for berry aroma, fruit flavor by mouth, and vanilla aroma." By quantifying wine aromas with a system of practical description, they discovered the vineyard conditions that produce them. Alexander Graham Bell would have been pleased.<br><br>What earned Ann Noble and her colleagues a place in the annals of smell classification was their Wine Aroma Wheel, published in 1984. The wheel was a visually pleasing presentation of a standardized wine aroma vocabulary. With twelve categories and ninety-four descriptive terms, it covers the aroma of any wine, regardless of grape or geographic origin. What makes the wheel just as useful to novices as to connoisseurs are the do-it-yourself reference standards. Simple kitchen chemistry lets anyone create and experience the standards for himself. Noble is critical of commercial wine-tasting kits; she believes that vials of flavor essence are chemically unstable and tend to degrade quickly. This spurred her to create reference standards that can be "prepared using foodstuffs available throughout the world during most seasons."<br><br>The Wine Aroma Wheel resembles a dartboard: three concentric circles divided pizzalike into a dozen slices of varying width. On the innermost circle, the pointed end of each wedge is an aroma category, such as fruity. In the middle circle, the wedge may be split into subcategories such as citrus, berry, or tree fruit. On the outer circle are specific materials, examples of each aroma subcategory. Thus you can follow the fruity wedge through the berry subslice to the outer circle; there you'll find blackberry, raspberry, strawberry, and blackcurrant. The beauty of Noble's wheel is that it links sensory concepts to actual everyday stuff--it connects Riesling to raspberries. Wheel in hand, it is possible to sniff your way to sensory enlightenment. This commonsense approach lets anyone grasp the esoteric inner-wedge category microbiological and its arcane subdivision lactic. It's only baffling until you sniff the examples: yogurt and sauerkraut. Then it clicks. The wheel even demystifies the wine-snob term wet dog: it's an example of sulfur aromas in the chemical category (along with skunk, cabbage, and burnt match).<br><br>There is no place on the wheel for the wine critic's gaseous adjectives. You will find "orange blossom" and "black olive" and the less flattering "soapy" and "cooked cabbage." But you will not find "an impertinent little Pinot Noir" or a "flabby, overripe Cabernet Franc," a la Miles Raymond. These free-form prose poems say more about a wine lover's pretensions than about the character of the wine. To use the wheel, all you need is a glass and grocery store.<br><br>A practical smell classification for beer was created in the 1970s by a Danish flavor chemist named Morten Meilgaard. His Beer Flavor Wheel has now been adopted worldwide. It uses fourteen categories and forty-four sensory terms to describe the smell and taste of any style of beer--lager, ale, or stout. Most of the descriptors deal with aroma; others involve taste (bitter for hops; sweet for malt) and sensory factors like carbonation.</p><h2>The Skills to Pay the Bills: The Story of the Beastie Boys</h2><p>In 1987, three white Jewish boys from New York City were the most fascinating phenomenon in the burgeoning rap music scene. No, really. The Beastie Boys, barely out of their teens, had just released <i>Licensed to Ill</i>, which quickly became the first hip-hop album to reach number one on the charts. Pairing vulgar and hilarious lyrics with heavy-metal-derived musical backing and a punk DIY attitude, the Beasties&#x2014;MCA (Adam Yauch), King Ad-Rock (Adam Horovitz), and Mike D (Michael Diamond)&#x2014;changed the face of rap forever by bringing it into the mainstream. In the years that followed, they would change it again and again&#x2014;musically, culturally, and politically. <br><br>To create <i>The Skills to Pay the Bills</i>, Alan Light spent years taping conversations with the group, their friends, roommates, producers, engineers, collaborators, and other artists from Madonna to Chuck D. Here, as told from the inside, is the fascinating tale of three rump-shaking, innovative rappers whose albums still go platinum and whose tours continue to fill arenas after more than two decades of making music. <i>The Skills to Pay the Bills</i> chronicles the Beasties&#x2019; unique journey from the hardcore New York underground to the top of the Billboard charts. It is a story of larger-than-life personalities, noble causes, funky beats, and truly one of the most influential and ambitious groups of all time.<br><br>I said, Where&#x2019;d you get your information from, huh?<br>&#x201c;The first time I met them, I thought I was on Candid Camera.&#x201d; &#x2014;D.M.C.<br><br>&#x201c;I think I made out with Adam Yauch once in their dressing room.&#x201d; &#x2014;Madonna<br><br>&#x201c;One of my favorite groups is the Beastie Boys.&#x201d; &#x2014;Bono</p><p>Alan Light is the former editor in chief of <i>Vibe</i>, <i>Spin</i>, and <i>Tracks</i> magazines, and a former senior writer for <i>Rolling Stone</i>. He is the editor of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Tupac Shakur</i> and <i>The Vibe History of Hip Hop</i>.1: Young and Useless: 1981&#x2013;82<br><br> ADAM YAUCH: I met this guy John Berry at Tier 3, a little teeny hole-in-the-wall punk club, and we hung out a little. Then a day or two later, John brought Mike with him. They had this band called the Young Aborigines&#x2014;Mike played drums, John played guitar, Kate Schellenbach played percussion.<br><br> JOHN BERRY: When I first met Adam Yauch, he was the funniest motherfucker I&#x2019;d ever met in my life. He had this incredible knack for picking up somebody&#x2019;s voice. He was really into Monty Python. I think a heavy influence of his was the silly-walk skit.<br><br> ADAM HOROVITZ: I have this memory of seeing Yauch at a record store. He wore an overcoat and boots and just looked funny. I&#x2019;m not saying that I looked cool, but he looked funny.<br><br> SASHA FRERE-JONES: I went to Saint Ann&#x2019;s in Brooklyn Heights, this private, progressive school. Mike D came in as a junior. He was from Manhattan, was into punk rock, and instantly started hanging out with all the cool, good-looking girls. He used to wear an Isaac Hayes T-shirt, which was incredibly cool at the time.<br><br> JILL CUNNIFF: When I met Mike, he had sort of crazy calico hair. Adam Yauch had a raincoat with &#x201c;White Riot&#x201d; spelled out on the back with pieces of tape, and combat boots. We all wanted to be hip, cool punkers.<br><br> BERRY: The first practice was at my house&#x2014;we called it the Hell House. Just a bunch of fucking noise. I don&#x2019;t think there was any direction, no one really taking any reins or being, like, the creative guru. It was just a bunch of kids dashing around.<br><br> KATE SCHELLENBACH: Adam Yauch started hanging around, and after rehearsal he&#x2019;d start playing the bass. He knew how to play &#x201c;Public Image&#x201d; by Public Image and that was it. Like two notes. Then we started switching around&#x2014;I&#x2019;d play drums and Yauch would play bass and we&#x2019;d make up songs about the bodega downstairs, stuff like that. Mike had nothing to do, so we made him the singer. Which was funny because he was so introverted and shy and so he was the least likely candidate to be lead singer.<br><br> YAUCH: We went and saw Black Flag one night. It was like when Black Flag first came to New York and Dez [Cadena] was singing, it was before Henry [Rollins]. I think it was actually the first time Henry ever saw Black Flag, too. And after we saw Black Flag, all these kids from D.C. started moshing, and we&#x2019;d never seen that before, diving off the stage. This was at Peppermint Lounge up on Seventy-seventh, or somewhere in Midtown. But I think we got kind of inspired by that. It was just when hardcore was kind of starting in the U.S., because we were listening to more punk bands coming over from England, Stiff Little Fingers and stuff like that. And things were starting to happen like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Public Image. And that&#x2019;s the kind of stuff that was inspiring us. Young Aborigines was more going toward those kind of P.I.L./Siouxsie sounds.<br><br> I think after we saw Black Flag, we thought we should start a hardcore band. There weren&#x2019;t really any New York hardcore bands, so it was kind of like the D.C. hardcore scene, there was sort of an L.A. punk scene. But Bad Brains was the first band that was really starting to play fast. And I guess Minor Threat was probably just coming out. And we were like, Let&#x2019;s start a New York hardcore band, kind of as a joke. And that was called Beastie Boys. We were trying to think of the stupidest name.<br><br> CUNNIFF: When we first saw Black Flag play, we thought it was really funny. Like, Look at these people banging into each other, look at this guy sweating with no shirt on. (laughs.) Like, &#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; They started the band as, like, a joke on that. I don&#x2019;t know if they say that about themselves now, but that&#x2019;s really what it was.<br><br> SCHELLENBACH: Adam Yauch was making buttons for bands, homemade buttons. And he made this &#x201c;Beastie Boys&#x201d; button and it was cool-looking. It was just a cool word, and then we adopted it. So the button came first, and then the band.<br><br> BERRY: This may be argued, but I think I actually came up with<br><br> the name. We decided that we should have a gang, an Elks Lodge&#x2013;type thing. We had secret handshakes and stuff and we&#x2019;d wear old-man clothes that we&#x2019;d find at Salvation Army, and we&#x2019;d smoke cigars. The thrust was pretty much to walk around and annoy people and just be obnoxious. I don&#x2019;t think there was an agenda, really.<br><br> YAUCH: The first gig was a party at John Berry&#x2019;s house. It was my seventeenth birthday, and we bought a whole bunch of beer. I think it was the first time Mike ever got drunk.<br><br> SCHELLENBACH: That was, like, a notorious party. All our friends came and then people who weren&#x2019;t our friends came and there was a fight, someone got beat up and people had to run. Upper West Side kids, downtown kids, Brooklyn kids. And we showed Super 8 films, we had TVs on, we played&#x2014;it was a multimedia experience.<br><br> YAUCH: Right after we played, Dave Parsons came up. He ran a record store downtown, Ratcage, and he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking about starting a record label, would you guys want to make a record?&#x201d; It was the first time we ever played, and we were playing at somebody&#x2019;s house. So&#x2014;sure!<br><br> ANTHONY COUNTEY: Dave Parsons was the focal person in New York, [the reason] why everybody knew each other. He had this brilliant record store in the basement, it was in the same space that Bad Brains recorded upstairs. Dave was bringing records in, you could find all the UK Subs and Cockney Rejects and all this English oi! stuff, all this punk stuff, all the most obscure stuff, and he would just get his hands on copies of everything. We were all there every day, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s new? What ya get?&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, yeah, Backstage Pass!&#x201d; All those great records.<br><br> Dave Parsons was wacky as hell at that time. He would wander around the Village, sometimes in a dress, and we never knew why&#x2014;he&#x2019;s not a transvestite. He now lives in Switzerland with his wife and a kid, and he&#x2019;s known around Europe as Charlot; he does a Charlie Chaplin routine for crowds in the summer. He&#x2019;s really good, he&#x2019;s very like Charlie&#x2014;he dresses like Charlie, walks around like Charlie with a cane, and climbs a ladder that isn&#x2019;t leaning against anything, and people love him! And put money in a hat and he lives on it! He is an amazing man, someone definitely worth biographing.<br><br> SCOTT JARVIS: Between the time we recorded [the songs that would become] Polly Wog Stew and when we mixed it a few weeks later, the studio sort of went under. The guy running the studio was on the road with Bad Brains and was supposed to be sending the rent, but it never came. And the guy who actually owned the space, his ex-girlfriend came by and told me that he was going to sell the equipment. So we had to scramble to get that stuff out of there. I took the tape machine over to my girlfriend&#x2019;s apartment. We laid all the equipment out on the bed, wired together. Everyone came over and we did the mixes there in the apartment, and edited it together with, like, paper leader tape and Scotch tape.<br><br> SCHELLENBACH: We didn&#x2019;t play a lot of shows, really only a handful. But they were good. We played A7 with Bad Brains, we opened for Circle Jerks.<br><br> THURSTON MOORE: The Beastie Boys were one of the bands in the first generation of the New York hardcore scene&#x2014;Heart Attack, The Mob, Urban Waste, Even Worse, the Nihilistics. They were really kids, but they weren&#x2019;t like street-rat kids&#x2014;they obviously had this edge over everybody else. Their humor was a little more sophisticated; it wasn&#x2019;t just fart-joke humor. Mike D was this skinny kid jumping up in the air and landing on the stage like this screaming little bird or something. They stood out. They were more weird than the rest of the hardcore bands.<br><br> COUNTEY: They were the youngest, freshest hardcore band, the most irreverent, satirical even, but really good. They were funny.<br><br> JESSE MALIN: My band Heart Attack used to play bills at CBGB with the Beastie Boys, and we&#x2019;d see each other at a place called Ratcage on Avenue A, which was the basement of a rehearsal studio. They were from uptown, and I was a borough kid from Queens, and so even though I liked some of their records I didn&#x2019;t fully relate. There were little cliques in those days, even though the scene was only a hundred people. It still had that schoolyard rivalry, and I never fully connected with those guys. I thought they were just ripping off Bad Brains&#x2014;but I was probably ripping off the Circle Jerks or something. They had their own kind of circle and they kind of hung with themselves. They were connected with these girls who dressed like the Slits and who had a fanzine called The Decline of Art. And to be quite honest, it seemed like they had money, and a lot of us didn&#x2019;t. In time everything changed and they became cool people. They took Murphy&#x2019;s Law out for their first tour and I thought that was really cool of them, and they seem to give back a lot. But in the beginning we were like, Oh, fuck those rich kids&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s how you are.<br><br> HILLY KRISTAL: The Beastie Boys were great. They were nice kids. It was a good band, very good. They played here at CBGB a few times, and then they changed a little bit and they got into other things. Would I have tagged them for success? No, I wouldn&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s hard to say who would be a success, because hardcore was never played on the radio. At that point there were so many things happening, you couldn&#x2019;...</p><h2>Americas Prisons (Opposing Viewpoints)</h2><p>Opposing Viewpoints Series<br>For over 25 years, the Greenhaven Press Opposing Viewpoints Series has developed and set the standard for current-issue studies.

From 1956 through the late 1970s, America dispatched its finest jazz musicians to the far corners of the earth, from Iraq to India, from the Congo to the Soviet Union, in order to win the hearts and minds of the Third World and to counter perceptions of American racism. </p><p> Penny Von Eschen escorts us across the globe, backstage and onstage, as Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and other jazz luminaries spread their music and their ideas further than the State Department anticipated. Both in concert and after hours, through political statements and romantic liaisons, these musicians broke through the government's official narrative and gave their audiences an unprecedented vision of the black American experience. In the process, new collaborations developed between Americans and the formerly colonized peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East--collaborations that fostered greater racial pride and solidarity. </p><p> Though intended as a color-blind promotion of democracy, this unique Cold War strategy unintentionally demonstrated the essential role of African Americans in U.S. national culture. Through the tales of these tours, Von Eschen captures the fascinating interplay between the efforts of the State Department and the progressive agendas of the artists themselves, as all struggled to redefine a more inclusive and integrated American nation on the world stage. </p></p><p><b>Penny M.

He has published eight critically acclaimed books of literary reportage and contributed to several others.<br><br>Translated by Tiina Nunnally.Wanted: one medium-sized Greenland shark, ten to fifteen feet in length and weighing about thirteen hundred pounds. Latin name: <i>Somniosus microcephalus</i>. Blunt, rounded snout, cigar-shaped body, relatively small fins. Gives birth to live offspring. Lives in the North Atlantic and even swims under the floating ice cap at the North Pole. Prefers temperatures close to freezing but can also tolerate warmer water. Can dive to a depth of four thousand feet or more. The teeth in its lower jaw are as small as a saw blade&#x2019;s. The teeth in the upper jaw are equally sharp but significantly bigger, and are used to bore into the prey while the lower teeth saw their way through. In addition to saw-blade teeth, it has, like a few other types of shark, suctioning lips that &#x201c;glue&#x201d; larger prey to its mouth while chewing. And every mating act is violent. On the bright side, the Greenland shark does not have sex until it&#x2019;s about 150 years old.<br><br>Scientists who have examined the stomach contents of Greenland sharks have encountered many surprises. How is it possible that in Greenland, Fridtjof Nansen (1861&#x2013; 1930), the famed Norwegian scientist, explorer, and politician, opened the stomach of a shark he&#x2019;d caught and found a whole seal, eight large cods, a ling four feet long, a big halibut head, and several chunks of whale blubber? Nansen claimed, by the way, that the shark was able to live for several days even after this &#x201c;huge, ugly animal&#x201d; had been cut open and placed on ice.<br><br>The eye parasite <i>Ommatokoita elongata</i>, which is about two inches long, slowly devours the cornea of the Greenland shark, until it goes blind. In the folds of its belly the shark also has other parasites in the form of little yellow crabs (<i>Aega arctica</i>). Old shark fishermen have recounted how the parasites would fall off by the hundreds when the shark was hoisted aboard.<br><br>The Greenland shark can be used for more than just making sandpaper and nitroglycerin. Its flesh is poisonous, smells like urine, and can serve as a potent drug. The Inuit used to feed the meat to their dogs, if nothing else was available. But the dogs would get extremely intoxicated and might even end up paralyzed for days. During World War I, there was a shortage of food in many places in the north, and people couldn&#x2019;t be choosy. There was more than enough meat from Greenland sharks. But if people ate the meat when it was fresh, or neglected to treat it in the proper way, they could get &#x201c;shark drunk,&#x201d; because the flesh contains the nerve gas trimethylamine oxide.<br><br>The resultant inebriated state is supposedly similar to taking in an extreme amount of alcohol or hallucinogenic drugs. Shark drunk people speak incoherently, see visions, stagger, and act very crazy. When they finally fall asleep, it&#x2019;s nearly impossible to wake them up. To avoid these side effects, you need to cut the main artery of a Greenland shark immediately, so that the blood drains out. Then the meat can be dried or boiled in water, which has to be changed several times. In Iceland, the shark (called <i>h�karl</i>) is considered a delicacy, but there everyone is careful to prepare the meat properly. To make the poisons disappear requires repeated boiling, drying, or even burying the meat&nbsp;until it ferments.<br><br>It should be no surprise that people living in northern Norway developed a healthy skepticism when it comes to the meat of the Greenland shark. The reason they even bothered to catch it was because the liver is extremely rich in oil. In the 1950s, Norway was the leader in commercial fishing for the Greenlandshark, but by the early 1960s, demand was already fading. Only now is it making a small comeback.<br>Our boat is gently bobbing in the sunshine in Vestfjorden. Yesterday the sea glittered and crackled with light. Today it has a steady, calm glow. The ocean has found its lowest resting pulse, as it does only after many days of good weather in the summertime. It&#x2019;s also a neap tide, which means the difference between high and low tide is unusually small. The gravitational force of the moon and the sun pull the sea in opposite directions, canceling each other out to a certain extent, like when two people arm-wrestle and neither has an advantage.<br><br>Our only task is to wait and keep an eye on the floats. Maybe it&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;re drifting in Vestfjorden&#x2014;where the currents function just fine on their own even when there&#x2019;s no wind&#x2014;that Hugo happens to think of a story about one time when he and his brother were out in their fishing smack. The boat, called the <i>Plingen</i>, was a small carvel-built vessel made in Namdalen in the 1950s. The fishing smack was waterlogged and sat low in the sea. In bad weather they had to pump out the water frantically by hand. One ice-cold day during the Lofoten fishing season in 1984, the two brothers went out during a squall. The motor wouldn&#x2019;t start, but another boat in the fishing grounds saw they were in trouble and towed them back to Svolv�r.<br><br>That reminds Hugo of a similar situation. They were on board the <i>Helnessund </i>heading out of Svolv�r after picking upa cargo of fresh shrimp that had been caught farther north in Finnmark. When a storm blew in, the boat quickly ran into trouble. The refrigeration unit failed and the cargo shifted. The freighter ended up drifting in the middle of Vestfjorden. By using countless buckets of seawater, they were finally able to cool down the engine enough to make it over to Skrova.<br><br>Hugo often makes these sorts of associative leaps. When one story starts getting a bit worn out, it taps the next one on the back and sends it off, in a relay race that can go on and on. The stories usually move further and further away from the starting point. Sometimes I get confused and wonder what Hugo&#x2019;s stories have to do with anything at all.<br><br>But something about what he has already told me makes Hugo think of M�l�ya, one of the small islands on the seawardside of Steigen. That&#x2019;s the location of a tiny, abandoned community that Hugo was curious about. Together with his brother, he dropped anchor and left the fishing smack to row a skiff, or <i>reksa</i>, as Hugo always calls these small wooden rowboats, toward a gently sloping sandy beach. But they misjudged the waves, and the little <i>reksa </i>got tossed around. Both brothers ended up in the icy water. They went ashore but didn&#x2019;t stay long because it was late winter, and the air and water were freezing. On their way back to the fishing smack, the <i>reksa</i> again filled up with water because a small crack in the bottom was now much bigger after the rowboat had been tossed by the waves. Just before the <i>reksa </i>sank, the brothers managed to grab hold of the fishing smack, not by the gunwale, but farther down. They clung to the small gap along the side of the deck where the water runs out. It was impossible for them to haul themselves on board, exhausted as they were, and with their soaked clothing heavy with seawater. After hanging there for a while, side by side like in some cartoon, they both realized how absurd the situation was and burst out laughing. But their strength was about to give out, and they needed to focus all their efforts on one last-ditch attempt to save themselves. So Hugo became a human ladder for his brother to climb up and clamber on board.<br><br>If Hugo had lost his grip before his brother made it on deck, it&#x2019;s unlikely either of them would be here to tell the story. But Hugo seems to think the main point of the whole tale is that a person doesn&#x2019;t actually get all that cold by floating in Vestfjordenfor nearly half an hour in March.<br><br>&#x201c;We stayed out for the rest of the day, and without changing our clothes. Although, I have to admit that behind our ears ,and at the back of our necks&#x2014;that&#x2019;s where the cold settled.&#x201d;<br><br>Sometimes I wonder whether my friend is actually part seamammal.<br><i>Translated by&nbsp;Tiina Nunnally.</i></p><h2>Night John</h2><p>Imagine being beaten for learning to read, shackled and whipped for learning a few letters of the alphabet.

This culture, based upon a separate language community with its own folkloric, musical, religious, and historical traditions, was created by slaves brought directly from Africa to Louisiana before 1731. It still survives as the acknowledged cultural heritage of tens of thousands of people of all races in the southern part of the state.<br>In this pathbreaking work, Gwendolyn Midlo Hall studies Louisiana's creole slave community during the eighteenth century, focusing on the slaves' African origins, the evolution of their own language and culture, and the role they played in the formation of the broader society, economy, and culture of the region. Hall bases her study on research in a wide range of archival sources in Louisiana, France, and Spain and employs several disciplines--history, anthropology, linguistics, and folklore--in her analysis. Among the topics she considers are the French slave trade from Africa to Louisiana, the ethnic origins of the slaves, and relations between African slaves and native Indians. She gives special consideration to race mixture between Africans, Indians, and whites; to the role of slaves in the Natchez Uprising of 1729; to slave unrest and conspiracies, including the Pointe Coupee conspiracies of 1791 and 1795; and to the development of communities of runaway slaves in the cypress swamps around New Orleans. Hall's text is enhanced by a number of tables, graphs, maps, and illustrations.<br>Hall attributes the exceptional vitality of Louisiana's creole slave communities to several factors: the large size of the African population relative to the white population; the importation of slaves directly from Africa; the enduring strength of African cultural features in the slave community; and the proximity of wilderness areas that permitted the establishment and long-term survival of maroon communities.<br>The result of many years of research and writing, Hall's book makes a unique and important contribution to the literature on colonial Louisiana and to the history of slavery and of African-American cultures.</p><p>&#39;Africans in Colonial Louisiana opens to view a new translational conception of American culture that grew from slavery and from slave resistance, and describes a process of creolization whose full effects have perhaps become only apparent, at least to scholars.&#39; -- John Hope Franklin<p>?</p><p>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, Consulting Research Professor at the University of New Orleans and professor of history at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, is also the author of Social Control in Slave Plantation Societies: A Comparison of St. Domingue and Cuba.</p></p><h2>New York and the China Trade</h2><p>The catalogue of an exhibition at the New-York Historical Society, 1984. 19 objects illustrated in color and numerous others in black and white.</p><p></p><h2>Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences (Dover Books on Physics)</h2><p>This is the standard translation of one of the greatest single works by one of Western sciences' greatest single men, the Renaissance physicist Galileo Galilei. Written near the end of his life, the book had to be published abroad and led to Galileo's condemnation. But he nevertheless considered it to be "superior to everything else of mine published."Despite the fact that the book encompasses thirty years of highly original experimentation and theorizing on the part of this singular man, it is eminently readable. Written as a discussion between a master and two students, it sets forth its hundreds of experiments and summarizes the conclusions Galileo drew from those experiments in a brisk, direct style. Using helpful geometric demonstrations, Galileo discusses aspects of fracture of solid bodies, cohesion, leverage, the speed of light, sound, pendulums, falling bodies, projectiles, uniform motion, accelerated motion, and the strength of wires, rods, and beams under different loadings and placements. <br>Not only does the book display the genius of one of the makers of our civilization, but it also presents, for the historian of science, considerable information about Renaissance misapprehensions that Galileo refuted. "The publishers are to be congratulated for making this celebrated book once more readily available." &#x2014; <i>Quarterly of Applied Physics.</i></p><p>Galileo Galilei (1564 1642) was an Italian physicist, mathematician, philosopher, and astronomer.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>Emperor The Blood Of Gods</h2><p>Spine creased.

Though Rome claimed to have finally brought civilization to Greece, he could see little sign of it in the hill villages. Away from the coast, the people were either suspicious of strangers or openly hostile. Even a simple request to use a well was met with frowns and doors shut in their faces. All the while, the sun beat down, reddening their necks. Octavian remembered how he had smiled when the local praetor said there were places in Greece where a young Roman had about as much chance of survival as a tax-�gatherer. It had been an exaggeration, but not by much.<br><br>He stopped to wipe sweat from his face. The land itself was wild, with canyons that seemed to drop forever. Octavian took a deep breath, suddenly certain he&#x2019;d be walking out. Nothing would give the local boys more pleasure than seeing three footsore Romans searching for stolen mounts.<br><br>Octavian stayed alert as he climbed, looking for some sign of the group of ragged men they followed. The trail had been easy at first, until it split and split again. Octavian didn&#x2019;t know if the bandits knew they would be pursued or had just taken different routes home, vanishing into the cauldron of mountains as their ancestors had done for thousands of years. He felt an itch and craned his neck to see as far as he could. It was too easy to imagine a bowman leaning over the lip of some crag and attacking before they even knew he was there.<br><br>&#x201c;Call out if you see anything,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Maecenas snorted, waving a hand at bare rocks. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a tracker,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;For all I know, they could have passed through here with a herd of goats just an hour ago. Why don&#x2019;t we go back to the main group and take up the search from there? This is not how I expected to spend my leave. I imagined more wine and less . . . climbing.&#x201d; He grunted as they reached a great step in the rocks.<br><br>There was no sign of a path and each man heaved himself up, their sandals skidding and scrambling as they went. The sun was fierce above and the sky was an aching blue. All three were sweating heavily and the single flask of water was already empty.<br><br>&#x201c;At least the men from the town know these hills,&#x201d; Maecenas went on. &#x201c;They know where to search.&#x201d;<br><br>Octavian didn&#x2019;t have the breath to respond. The slope grew steeper and steeper until he had to use his hands to steady each step, then really climb. He was panting lightly as he reached the top of a crag and stared, judging the best route down the other side. The maze of gray rocks stretched into the distance, empty of life beyond the lizards that skittered away with every step.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have me stand by and watch, doing nothing to help them?&#x201d; Octavian said suddenly. &#x201c;A rape and a murder, Maecenas. You saw her body. What honor would there be in letting a few farmers chase them down while we stand and watch, confirming everything they say about idle Romans? Come on.&#x201d;<br><br>He jerked his head at a route that would take them to the floor of the canyon and began climbing down. At least the shadowed clefts were cooler, until they climbed back into the burning sun once more.<br><br>&#x201c;Why should I care what Greek peasants say?&#x201d; Maecenas muttered, though he pitched his voice too low to be heard. Maecenas was of such ancient lineage that he refused to claim descent from the twins who suckled at a she-�wolf and went on to found Rome. His people, he said, had owned the wolf. When they&#x2019;d first met, he&#x2019;d assumed Octavian had known Caesar, so a mere Roman noble could not impress him. Over time, he&#x2019;d realized Octavian took Maecenas at the value he set for himself. It was slightly galling to have to live up to his own sense of superiority. Maecenas felt that Octavian had rather missed the point of noble families. It wasn&#x2019;t who you were&#x2014;�it was who your ancestors had been that mattered. Yet somehow that simple faith was something he could not shatter in his friend. Octavian had known poverty, with his father dying early. If he thought a true Roman noble would be brave and honorable, Maecenas didn&#x2019;t want to disappoint him.<br><br>Maecenas sighed at the thought. They wore simple tunics and darker leggings. Any clothing was too hot for climbing in the noon sun, but the leggings were terrible, already dark with perspiration. He was convinced he&#x2019;d rubbed himself raw under them. He could smell his own sweat as he climbed and skidded down, wrinkling his nose in distaste. The scabbard of his sword caught in a crevice and Maecenas swore as he freed it. His expression darkened as he heard Agrippa laugh behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;I am glad to provide some amusement for you, Agrippa,&#x201d; he snapped. &#x201c;The pleasures of this day are now complete.&#x201d;<br><br>Agrippa gave a tight smile without replying as he came level and then went past, using his great strength and size to take enormous steps down the crag. The fleet centurion was a head taller than his companions and the constant labor on board Roman galleys had only increased the power in his arms and legs. He made the climb look easy and was still breathing lightly by the time he reached the bottom. Octavian was a few steps behind and the pair waited for Maecenas as he clambered down after them.<br><br>&#x201c;You realize we&#x2019;ll have to go back up that hill again when we turn around?&#x201d; Maecenas said as he jumped the last few feet.<br><br>Octavian groaned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to argue with you, Maecenas. It would be easier if you just accepted we are doing this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Without complaining,&#x201d; Agrippa added. His deep voice echoed back from the stone all around them and Maecenas looked sourly at them both.<br><br>&#x201c;There are a thousand different paths through these cursed rocks,&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;I should think the bandits are far away from here by now, sipping cool drinks while we die of thirst.&#x201d;<br><br>Gleefully, Agrippa pointed at the dusty ground and Maecenas looked down, seeing the footprints of many men.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. He drew his sword in a smooth motion, as if he expected an immediate attack. &#x201c;Probably local herders, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Octavian replied, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;re the only ones following this path, so I would like to be sure.&#x201d; He too drew his gladius, shorter than Maecenas&#x2019;s duelist&#x2019;s blade by a hand&#x2019;s breadth, but well oiled, so that it slid free with barely a whisper. He could feel the heat of the blade.<br><br>Agrippa freed his own sword and together the three men walked silently into the canyon ahead, placing their steps with caution. Without planning it, Octavian took the lead, with Agrippa&#x2019;s bulk on his right shoulder and Maecenas on his left. Ever since they had become friends, Octavian had led the group as if there were no alternative. It was the kind of natural confidence Maecenas appreciated and recognized. Old families had to start somewhere, even when they began with a Caesar. He smiled at the thought, though the expression froze as they came around a spire of rock and saw men waiting for them in the shadows. Octavian walked on without a jerk, keeping his sword lowered. Three more steps brought him into the gloom of the chasm, with rock walls stretching up above their heads. He came to a halt, looking coldly at the men in his way.<br><br>There was another path out on the other side and Maecenas noticed laden mules waiting patiently. The men they faced did not seem surprised or afraid, perhaps because there were eight of them, staring with bright-�eyed interest at the three young Romans. The biggest of the men raised a sword from another age, a great length of iron that was more like a cleaver than anything else. He sported a black beard that reached right down to his chest and Maecenas could see the bulge of heavy muscles under a ragged jerkin as he moved. The man grinned at them, revealing missing teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;You are a very long way from your friends,&#x201d; the man said in Greek.<br><br>Maecenas knew the language, though Octavian and Agrippa spoke not a word. Neither of them looked around with so many blades being pointed in their direction, but Maecenas could feel their expectation.<br><br>&#x201c;Must I translate?&#x201d; he said, dredging up the words from his memory. &#x201c;I know the high speech, but your peasant accent is so thick, I can hardly understand you. It is like the grunting of a dying mule. Speak slowly and clearly, as if you were apologizing to your master.&#x201d;<br><br>The man looked at him in surprise, anger darkening his face. He was aware that the death of Romans would make him a wanted man, but the mountains had hidden bodies before and would again. He tilted his head slightly, weighing his choices.<br><br>&#x201c;We want the one who raped and strangled the woman,&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;Hand him over to us and go back to your short and pointless lives.&#x201d;<br><br>The leader of the bandits growled deep in his throat and took a step forward.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you saying to him?&#x201d; Octavian asked without taking his eyes off the man.<br><br>&#x201c;I am praising his fine beard,&#x201d; Maecenas replied. &#x201c;I have never seen one like it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maecenas!&#x201d; Octavian snapped. &#x201c;It has to be them. Just find out if he knows the one we came to find.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, beard? Do you know the one we want?&#x201d; Maecenas went on, switching languages.<br><br>&#x201c;I am the one you want, Roman,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But if you have come here alone, you have made a mistake.&#x201d;<br><br>The bandit looked up the rocks to the blue sky, searching for any hint of a moving shadow that would reveal an ambush or a trap. He grunted, satisfied, then glanced at his sharp-�eyed companions. One of them was dark and thin, his face dominated by a great blade of a nose. In response, the man shrugged, raising a dagger with unmistakable intent.<br><br>Octavian stepped forward without warning of any kind. With a vicious flick, he brought his sword across so that it cut the throat of the closest man to him. The man dropped his dagger to hold his neck with both hands, suddenly choking as he fell to his knees.<br><br>The leader of the bandits froze, then gave a great bellow of rage with the rest of his men. He raised his sword for a crushing blow, but Agrippa jumped in, gripping the sword arm with his left hand and stabbing his short blade up between the man&#x2019;s ribs. The leader collapsed like a punctured wineskin, falling onto his back with an echoing crash.<br><br>For a heartbeat, the bandits hesitated, shocked by the explosion of violence and death. Octavian had not stopped moving. He killed another gaping bandit with a backhand stroke against his throat, chopping into flesh. He&#x2019;d set his feet well and brought the whole of his strength into the blow, so that it almost decapitated the man. The gladius was made for such work and the weight felt good in his hand.<br><br>The rest might have run then, if their way hadn&#x2019;t been blocked by their own mules. Forced to stand, they fought with vicious intensity for desperate moments as the three Romans lunged and darted among them. All three had been trained from a young age. They were professional soldiers and the bandits were more used to frightening villagers who would not dare to raise a blade against them. They fought hard but uselessly, seeing their blades knocked away and then unable to stop the return blows cutting them. The small canyon was filled with grunting and gasping as the bandits were cut down in short, chopping blows. None of the Romans was armored, but they stood close to one another, protecting their left sides as the swords rose and fell, with warm blood slipping off the warmer steel.<br><br>It was over in a dozen heartbeats and Octavian, Agrippa, and Maecenas were alone and panting. Octavian and Agrippa were both bleeding from gashes on their arms, but they were unaware of the wounds, still grim-�eyed with the violence.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take the heads back,&#x201d; Octavian said. &#x201c;The woman&#x2019;s husband will want to see them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All of them?&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;One is enough, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>Octavian looked at his friend, then reached out and gripped his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve done well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thank you. But we can make a sack from their clothing. I want that village to know that Romans killed these men. They will remember&#x2014;�and I suspect they will break out the casks of their best wine and slaughter a couple of goats or pigs as well. You might even find a willing girl. Just take the heads.&#x201d;<br><br>Maecenas grimaced. He&#x2019;d spent his childhood with servants to attend to every whim, yet somehow Octavian had him working and sweating like a house slave. If his old tutors could see him, they would be standing in slack-�jawed amazement.<br><br>&#x201c;The daughters have mustaches as thick as their fathers&#x2019;,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Perhaps when it&#x2019;s fully dark, but not before.&#x201d;<br><br>With a scowl, he began the grisly work of cutting heads. Agrippa joined him, bringing his sword down in great hacking blows to break through bone.<br><br>Octavian knelt next to the body of the bandit leader, looking down into the glazed eyes for a moment. He nodded to himself, playing over the movements of the fight in his head and only then noticing the gash on his arm that was still bleeding heavily. At twenty years old, it was not the first time he&#x2019;d been cut. It was just one more scar to add to the rest. He began to chop the head free, using the oily beard to hold it steady.<br><br>The horses were still there when they came back, parched and staggering, with their tongues swelling in their mouths. It was sunset by the time the three Romans reached the village, with two sopping red sacks that dribbled their contents with every step. The local men had returned angry and empty-�handed, but the mood changed when Octavian opened the sacks onto the road, sending heads tumbling into the dust. The woman&#x2019;s husband embraced and kissed him with tears in his eyes, breaking off only to dash the heads against the wall of his house, then crushing Octavian to him once more. There was no need to translate as they left the man and his children to their mourning.<br><br>The other villagers brought food and drinks from cool cellars, setting up rough tables in the evening air so that they could feast the young men. As Octavian had imagined, he and his friends could hardly move for good meat and a clear drink that tasted of aniseed. They drank with no thought for the morning, matching the local men cup for cup until the village swam and blurred before their eyes. Very few of the villagers could speak Roman, but it didn&#x2019;t seem to matter.<br><br>Through a drunken haze, Octavian became aware that Maecenas was repeating a question to him. He listened blearily, then gave a laugh, which turned into a curse at his own clumsiness as he spilled his cup.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t believe that,&#x201d; he told Maecenas. &#x201c;They call it the eternal city for a reason. There will be Romans here for a thousand years, longer. Or do you think some other nation will rise up and be our masters?&#x201d; He watched his cup being refilled with beady concentration.<br><br>&#x201c;Athens, Sparta, Thebes . . .&#x201d; Maecenas replied, counting on his fingers. &#x201c;Names of gold, Octavian. No doubt the men of those cities thought the same. When Alexander was wasting his life in battles abroad, do you think he would have believed Romans would one day rule their lands from coast to coast? He would have laughed like a donkey, much as you are doing.&#x201d; Maecenas smiled as he spoke, enjoying making his friend splutter into his cup with each outrageous comment.<br><br>&#x201c;Wasting his life?&#x201d; Octavian said when he had recovered from coughing. &#x201c;You are seriously suggesting Alexander the Great could have spent his years more fruitfully? I will not rise to it. I will be a stern and noble Roman, too . . .&#x201d; He paused. The drink had muddled his thoughts. &#x201c;Too stern and noble to listen to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Alexander had the greedy fingers of a merchant,&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;Always busy, busy, and what did it get him?

Like so many others, this charismatic Midwestern basketball coach wanted a reason to have hope. Traveling from farm to farm near the tiny Oklahoma college where he coached, Babb recruited talented, hardworking young women and offered them a chance at a better life: a free college education in exchange for playing on his basketball team, the Cardinals. &nbsp;<br><br> Despite their fears of leaving home and the sacrifices that their families would face, the women joined the team. And as Babb coached the Cardinals, something extraordinary happened. These remarkable athletes found a passion for the game and a heartfelt loyalty to one another and their coach--and they began to win.<br><br> Combining exhilarating sports writing and exceptional storytelling, <i>Dust Bowl Girls</i> takes readers on the Cardinals&#x2019; intense, improbable journey all the way to an epic showdown with the prevailing national champions, helmed by the legendary Babe Didrikson. Lydia Reeder captures a moment in history when female athletes faced intense scrutiny from influential figures in politics, education, and medicine who denounced women&#x2019;s sports as unhealthy and unladylike. At a time when a struggling nation was hungry for inspiration, this unlikely group of trailblazers achieved much more than a championship season.</p><p>Lydia Ellen Reeder is the grandniece of Sam Babb, the extraordinary basketball coach featured in <i>Dust Bowl Girls</i>.

The real killer is still at large, and having tinkered with Kate's car, nearly causes her to crash. Not only that, but Scotland Yard has turned their back on her. As Kate edges toward the shocking truth, she's going to need all the strength and resourcefulness she can muster to uncover this sinister web of deceit.</p><p><b>Frances Brody</b> lives in Leeds where she was born and grew up.

Hersh</p><p></p><h2>Blackwood Farm</h2><p>In her new novel, perennial bestseller Anne Rice fuses her two uniquely seductive strains of narrative -- her Vampire legend and her lore of the Mayfair witches -- to give us a world of classic deep-south luxury and ancestral secrets. Welcome to Blackwood Farm: soaring white columns, spacious drawing rooms, bright, sun-drenched gardens, and a dark strip of the dense Sugar Devil Swamp. This is the world of Quinn Blackwood, a brilliant young man haunted since birth by a mysterious doppelg�nger, &#34;Goblin,&#34; a spirit from a dream world that Quinn can&#39;t escape and that prevents him from belonging anywhere. When Quinn is made a Vampire, losing all that is rightfully his and gaining an unwanted immortality, his doppelg�nger becomes even more vampiric and terrifying than Quinn himself. As the novel moves backwards and forwards in time, from Quinn&#39;s boyhood on Blackwood Farm to present day New Orleans, from ancient Athens to 19th-century Naples, Quinn seeks out the legendary Vampire Lestat in the hope of freeing himself from the spectre that draws him inexorably back to Sugar Devil Swamp and the explosive secrets it holds. A story of youth and promise, of loss and the search for love, of secrets and destiny, Blackwood Farm is Anne Rice at her mesmerizing best.</p><p>In the past few years, many fans have sworn off Anne Rice, flinging her later novels against the wall with cries of "First draft!" and "Never again!" But these same fans may want to take a chance on her Southern gothic <i>Blackwood Farm</i>, a fast-paced and erotically charged, though uneven, novel of the Vampire Chronicles. <i>Blackwood Farm</i> has an unusual flaw: it isn't long enough. Many of its triumphs and tragedies demand more development than they receive. Motivations are sometimes unlikely or unexplained, and the ending is far too rushed.<p> <i>Blackwood Farm</i> introduces Quinn Blackwood, the sexy, eccentric young gentleman who becomes both a vampire and the heir to the Blackwood estate. All his life, Quinn has been haunted by Goblin, a doppelg�nger no one else can see--or believe in. But Goblin is real, and he is becoming maliciously tangible, strengthened by the blood that Quinn unwillingly drinks. Quinn's only hope of liberation from his increasingly dangerous doppelg�nger is to find the legendary vampire Lestat. But Lestat has vowed to destroy any vampire who sets foot in New Orleans.... </p><p> <i>Blackwood Farm</i> features characters from both the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches series, but this self-contained novel makes a good entry point for newcomers to Anne Rice's fictional world (however, Vampire Chronicle virgins really should start with <i>Interview With the Vampire</i>, the first in the series and arguably the finest vampire novel of the 20th century). <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><b>Praise for Anne Rice:</b><br><br>&#x201c;Rice&#x2019;s strengths as a writer [include] her knack for colourful characters, her loving attention to historical detail [and] her imaginative exploration of myth and mysticism.&#x201d; -- <i>The Globe and Mail</i><br><br>&#x201c;[<b>Merrick</b>] is a book where Rice&#x2019;s two worlds -- of witches and vampires -- finally collide.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Ottawa Citizen</i><br><i>From the Audio Cassette (Unabridged) edition.</i></p><h2>Celtic Knotwork Designs</h2><p>&#x201c;Sturrock shows the step-by-step process....Color renderings and good contrast in layout make this easier to use than other books on knotwork....A separate chapter shows examples of Celtic knot designs used in crafts such as needlework or ceramics.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal.</i> &#x201c;An ingeniously simple technique that breaks down the steps into a series of curves and lines; you can make the most intricate and mysterious designs.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Irish American News.</i><br></p><p>Craftspersons who have copied Celtic knotwork designs for their own work know that the construction process is not obvious in the finished design.

His two number one bestselling series, on Julius Caesar and on the Mongol Khans of Central Asia, describe the founding of the greatest empires of their day. Conn Iggulden lives in Hertfordshire with his wife and their children.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>Pompey pronounced each word as a hammer blow: "Therefore, by his actions, Caesar is today declared Enemy of Rome. His titles and honors are revoked. His right to command legions is struck from the records. His life is forfeit. It will be war."<br><br>The Senate chamber was finally still after the storms of debate, the tension showing in every face. The messengers who had killed horses to reach them had no way of knowing the pace of those who followed. The Rubicon line had been crossed and the legions of Gaul were racing south.<br><br>Pompey had aged visibly over two days of strain, yet he stood before them with a straight back, his experience giving him the strength to dominate the room. He watched as the senators slowly lost their frozen expressions, and saw dozens of them meet each other's eyes in private communication. There were many there who still blamed Pompey for the chaos in the city three years before. It had been his legion that had failed to maintain order then and his Dictatorship that had arisen from that conflict. He knew there were more than a few voices muttering for him to put aside the position and elect consuls once again. The very building in which they sat was a constant reminder, with its smell of fresh lime and wood. The ashes of the old site had been cleared, but the foundations remained as a mute testament to the destruction and rioting in the city.<br><br>In the silence, Pompey wondered whom he could trust in the struggle. Who amongst them had the strength he needed? He had no illusions. Julius was coming south with four veteran legions and there was nothing in Rome to stand against them. In just a few days, the commander of Gaul would be hammering at the gates of the city and some of the men before Pompey would clamor to let him in.<br><br>"There are hard choices to be made, gentlemen," he said.<br><br>They watched him closely, judging his strength, his weaknesses. One slip, he knew, and they would tear him apart. He would not give them the chance.<br><br>"I have legions in Greece who have not been infected by the enthusiasms of the mob in Rome. Though there may be traitors in this city, the rule of law has not lost its voice in our dominions."<br><br>How closely he watched them then to see who looked away, but every eye was on him.<br><br>"Gentlemen, there is no other option but to leave Rome for Greece and gather our armies there. At present, the bulk of Caesar's forces remain in Gaul. Once they join him, the whole country could fall before we have a sufficient presence in the field. I do not wish to lose a race to reinforce. Better to be certain and go to our armies. There are ten legions in Greece waiting for the call to defend against this traitor. We must not disappoint them.<br><br>"If he remains in our city, we will return to tear him out, exactly as Cornelius Sulla did to his uncle. The battle must be joined with him. He has made that clear by ignoring the lawful orders of this Senate. There can be no agreements, no peace while he lives. Rome cannot have two masters and I will <i>not</i> allow a rogue general to destroy what we have all built here."<br><br>Pompey's voice softened slightly and he leaned forward on the rostrum, the smell of wax and oil strong in his nostrils.<br><br>"If, through our weakness, he is allowed to live, to triumph, then every general we send out from Rome will wonder if he cannot do the same. If Caesar is not crushed, this city will never know peace again. What we have built will be worn down by constant war over generations until there is <i>nothing</i> left to show that we were once here under the eyes of the gods, and that we stood for order. I defy the man who would steal it from us. I defy him and I will see him dead."<br><br>Many of them were on their feet, their eyes bright. Pompey barely looked at those he despised, men filled more with air than courage. The Senate had never been short of speakers, but the rostrum was his.<br><br>"My legion is not up to strength and only a fool would deny the value of the battles in Gaul to his men. Even with the guards from the road forts, we do not have sufficient force to guarantee a victory. Do not think I enter into this lightly. I greet the news with pain and anger, but I will not scorn him from our gates and then lose my city under me."<br><br>He paused and waved his hand lightly at those who had risen. Confused, they sat down, frowning.<br><br>"When he comes, he will find this Senate house empty, with the doors broken from their hinges."<br><br>He waited through the uproar as they understood at last that he did not intend to leave alone.<br><br>"With his legions raping your wives and daughters, how many of you will stand against him if you are left behind? He will come in looking for blood and will find nothing! We are the government, the heart of the city. Where we are, is Rome. He will be nothing more than a ruthless invader without you to put the seal of law on his words and actions. We must deny him our legitimacy."<br><br>"The people will think&#x2014;" someone began from the back.<br><br>Pompey shouted over the voice, "The people will endure him as they have endured all their history! Do you think it would be better to leave you here while I gather an army on my own? How long would you last under torture, Marcellus? Or any of you? This Senate would be his and the final barrier would be overcome."<br><br>Out of the corner of his eye, Pompey saw the orator Cicero rise and suppressed his irritation. The senators looked at the small figure and then at Pompey, seeing him hesitate. Cicero spoke before he too could be waved down.<br><br>"You have said little of the communications we sent to Caesar. Why have we not discussed his offer to halt?"<br><br>Pompey frowned at the nodding heads around him. He sensed they would not stand for a blustering answer.<br><br>"His terms were unacceptable, Cicero, as he knew they would be. He seeks to drive a wedge between us with his promises. Do you really believe he will end his drive south simply because I have left the city? You do not know him."<br><br>Cicero folded his arms across his narrow chest, raising one hand until he could stroke the skin of his throat.<br><br>"Perhaps, though, this is the place to debate the issue. Better to have it out in the open than leave it to be discussed in private. Have you responded to his offer, Pompey? I recall you said you would answer him."<br><br>The two men locked gazes and Pompey gripped the rostrum more tightly as he struggled not to lose patience. Cicero was a subtle man, but Pompey had hoped he could depend on him.<br><br>"I have done everything I said I would. I wrote under Senate seal to demand he return to Gaul. I will not negotiate while his legions are within striking distance of my city, and he knows it. His words are simply to confuse us and cause delay. They mean nothing."<br><br>Cicero raised his head. "I agree, Pompey, though I believe all information should be made available to us here." Choosing not to see Pompey's surprise, Cicero turned his head to address the senators on the benches around him. "I do wonder if we are discussing a Roman general or another Hannibal who will be satisfied with nothing less than power torn from our hands. What right does Caesar have to demand that Pompey leave the city? Do we now negotiate with invaders? We are the government of Rome and we are threatened by a mad dog, leading armies we trained and created. Do not underestimate the danger in this. I concur with Pompey. Though it will hurt worse than anything we have suffered before, we must retreat to gather loyal forces in Greece. The rule of law must not bend for the whims of our generals, or we are no more than another tribe of savages."<br><br>Cicero sat down, after meeting Pompey's eyes with a brief flicker of amusement.

Wherever he looked, he could see dark patches of his men as they rested amongst the golden crops and ate cold meat and vegetables. Cooking fires had been forbidden as they crossed into the lowlands of Etruria. The wheat was dry and rough to the touch and a single spark could send sheets of flame racing across the fields. Julius almost smiled at the peaceful scene. Fifteen thousand of the most experienced soldiers in the world and he could hear them laughing and singing like children. It was a strange thing to be there, out in the open. He could hear the calls of birds he had known as a boy, and when he reached down and took a little of the leaf mulch in his hand, he was home.<br><br>"It is a fine thing to be here," he said to Octavian.

Enter the realm of the mightiest imagination of our time as the Last Gunslinger crosses the desert of damnation and approaches the Dark Tower of his dreams and nightmares. 12 full-color illustrations; line art throughout.</p><p>Stephen King, the world&#39;s bestselling novelist, was educated at the University of Maine at Orono. He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, and their children in Bangor, Maine.<b>38</b> <p> JAKE HAD NO CLEAR memory of the time which followed, and that was probably merciful. He had left his world over a year before nine hundred people would commit suicide together in a small South American country called Guyana, but he knew about the periodic death-rushes of the lemmings, and what was happening in the disintegrating undercity of the Grays was like that. </p><p> There were explosions, some on their level but most far below them; acrid smoke occasionally drifted from the ventilator grilles, but most of the air-purifiers were still working and they whipped the worst of it away before it could gather in choking clouds. They saw no fires. Yet the Grays were reacting as if the time of the apocalypse had come. Most only fled, their faces blank O's of panic, but many had committed suicide in the halls and interconnected rooms through which the steel sphere led Roland and Jake. Some had shot themselves; many more had slashed their throats or wrists; a few appeared to have swallowed poison. On all the faces of the dead was the same expression of overmastering terror. Jake could only vaguely understand what had driven them to this. Roland had a better idea of what had happened to them-to their minds-when the long-dead city first came to life around them and then seemed to commence tearing itself apart. And it was Roland who understood that Blaine was doing it on purpose. That Blaine was driving them to it. </p><p> They ducked around a man hanging from an overhead heating-duct and pounded down a flight of steel stairs behind the floating steel ball. </p><p> "Jake!" Roland shouted. "You never let me in at all, did you?" </p><p> Jake shook his head. </p><p> "I didn't think so. It was Blaine." </p><p> They reached the bottom of the stairs and hurried along a narrow corridor toward a hatch with the words ABSOLUTELY NO ADMITTANCE printed on it in the spiked letters of the High Speech. </p><p> "Is it Blaine?" Jake asked. </p><p> "Yes-that's as good a name as any." </p><p> "What about the other v-" </p><p> "Hush!" Roland said grimly. </p><p> The steel ball paused in front of the hatchway. The wheel spun and the hatch popped ajar. Roland pulled it open, and they stepped into a huge underground room which stretched away in three directions as far as they could see. It was filled with seemingly endless aisles of control panels and electronic equipment. Most of the panels were still dark and dead, but as Jake and Roland stood inside the door, looking about with wide eyes, they could see pilot-lights coming on and hear machinery cycling up. </p><p> "The Tick-Tock Man said there were thousands of computers," Jake said. "I guess he was right. My God, look!" </p><p> Roland did not understand the word Jake had used and so said nothing. He only watched as row after row of panels lit up. A cloud of sparks and a momentary tongue of green fire jumped from one of the consoles as some ancient piece of equipment malfunctioned. </p><p> Most of the machinery, however, appeared to be up and running just fine.

Heavily illustrated, 148 pgs, 4-color, 8.5 x 11" with techniques CERTAIN to generate enormous creative inspiration. Covers tools to achieve many textures specific to the process. Gallery, Projects, element construction &amp; cold connections. One will find difficulty exhausting the adventuresome exploration &amp; excitement available with corrugation. Here's part of a review of the book from metalsmith/jeweler guru Tim McCreight: "It doesn't take long to realize that crimping metal is work born in equal parts of enthusiasm, exploration, and diligence. One of the pieces made by the author bears the date 1992 and it seems like a safe bet that work on this book goes back that far. Trish McAleer has assembled a sophisticated reference that combines instruction with examples, shot through with encouragement and zeal. Corrugation, as we learn in the introduction, is not new. Mollusks, plants, engineers, and package designers have long used rhythmic parallel pleats to gain increased strength with less material. Ancient and universal visual references are made to wind-combed sand dunes, plowed fields, and natural rivulets. This book focuses on micro-corrugation on metal, mostly thin sheets. While tools have been developed just for this purpose, more common tools are crimpers used to extract the last squeeze from a tube or a category of tools used in paper craft. When applied to sheet metal the result is a wavy panel with parallel crests and troughs. This makes an appealing pattern and can be used as is. By pinching one edge together, one can make a miniature fan; a trick I used to do in church on hot Sunday mornings. Most people would stop there, but fortunately for us, Ms. McAleer didn't stop.</p><p></p><h2>The Circle of Karma</h2><p>Caught in the everyday reality of household life, fifteen-year-old Tsomo is suddenly called upon to travel when her mother dies.

Full of music, magic, love, and loss, Patrick Rothfuss's vivid and engaging debut fantasy knocked our socks off. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> <p> </p> <b> 10 Second Interview: A Few Words with Patrick Rothfuss</b><br><br> <b>Q:</b> Were you always a fan of fantasy novels?<br> <b>A:</b> Always. My first non-picture books were the Narnia Chronicles. After that my mom gave me <i>Ihe Hobbit</i> and <i>Dragonriders</i>. I grew up reading about every fantasy and sci-fi book I could find. I used to go to the local bookstore and look at the paperbacks on the shelf. I read non-fantasy stuff too, of course. But fantasy is where my heart lies. Wait... Should that be "where my heart lays?" I always screw that up. <br><br> <b>Q:</b> Who are some of your favorite authors? Favorite books?<br> <b>A:</b> Hmmm.... How about I post that up as a list? <br><br> <b>Q:</b> What are you reading now?<br> <b>A:</b> Right now I'm reading <i>Capacity</i>, by Tony Balantyne. He was nominated for the Philip K Dick award this last year. I heard him read a piece of the first novel, <i>Recursion</i>, out at Norwescon. I picked it up and got pulled right in. <i>Capacity</i> is the second book in the series. Good writing and cool ideas. Everything I've like best. <br><br> <b>Q:</b> How did Kvothe's story come to you? Did you always plan on a trilogy?<br> <b>A:</b> This story started with Kvothe's character. I knew it was going to be about him from the very beginning. In some ways it's the simplest story possible: it's the story of a man's life. It's the myth of the Hero seen from backstage. It's about the exploration and revelation of a world, but it's also about Kvothe's desire to uncover the truth hidden underneath the stories in his world. The story is a lot of things, I guess. As you can tell, I'm not very good at describing it. I always tell people, "If I could sum it up in 50 words, I wouldn't have needed to write a whole novel about it." I didn't plan it as a trilogy though. I just wrote it and it got to be so long that it had to be broken up into pieces. There were three natural breaking points in the story.... Hence the Trilogy. <br><br> <b>Q:</b> What is next for our hero?<br> <b>A:</b> Hmm..... I don't really believe in spoilers. But I think it's safe to say that Kvothe grows up a little in the second book. He learns more about magic. He learns how to fight, gets tangled up in some court politics, and starts to figure unravel some of the mysteries of romance and relationships, which is really just magic of a different kind, in a way. <br><br> <br> <strong>Patrick Rothfuss's Books You Should Read</strong> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br><i>The Last Unicorn</i></td> <td> <br><i>Neverwhere</i></td> <td> <br><i>Declare</i></td> <td> <br><i>Beatrice's Goat</i></td> <td> <br><i>Blankets</i></td> </tr></tbody></table> <br> See more recommendations (with comments) from Patrick Rothfuss<br><p></p> <p> </p>My name is Kvothe, pronounced nearly the same as "quothe." Names are important as they tell you a great deal about a person. I've had more names than anyone has a right to. <p>The Adem call me Maedre. Which, depending on how it's spoken, can mean The Flame, The Thunder, or The Broken Tree. </p><p>"The Flame" is obvious if you've ever seen me. I have red hair, bright. If I had been born a couple of hundred years ago I would probably have been burned as a demon. I keep it short but it's unruly. When left to its own devices, it sticks up and makes me look as if I have been set afire. </p><p>"The Thunder" I attribute to a strong baritone and a great deal of stage training at an early age. </p><p>I've never thought of "The Broken Tree" as very significant. Although in retrospect, I suppose it could be considered at least partially prophetic. </p><p>My first mentor called me E'lir because I was clever and I knew it. My first real lover called me Dulator because she liked the sound of it. I have been called Shadicar, Lightfinger, and Six-String. I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them. </p><p>But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant "to know." </p><p>I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned. </p><p>I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon.

I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. </p><p>You may have heard of me. </p><p>So begins the tale of Kvothe-from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe as a notorious magician, an accomplished thief, a masterful musician, and an infamous assassin. But <i>The Name of the Wind</i> is so much more-for the story it tells reveals the truth behind Kvothe's legend.</p></p><h2>Emily the Strange: Dark Times (Emily the Strange, 3)</h2><p><p>Emily's uniquely strange homeschool syllabus includes:</p><p>1.

Within a few decades, Berman argues, the United States will be marginalized on the world stage, its hegemony replaced by China or the European Union. With the United States just one terrorist attack away from a police state, Berman's book is a controversial and illuminating look at our current society and its ills.</p><p><b>From author Morris Berman</b>: When I published my previous book in 2000, I characterized the historical phase we were in as a "twilight" period, similar to Rome in the waning days of its late-empire phase. It seems to me that it is not entirely an exaggeration to suggest that since 2000 we have effectively transited from twilight to night, entered a new Dark Age. Thus there are a number of developments that can be characterized as frankly medieval: the triumph of religion over reason, and a progressive rollback of Enlightenment humanism; a massive breakdown of education and critical thinking (the statistics of which will probably strike the reader as surreal); the actual legalization of torture, and its widespread use by the American government; and the growing political and economic marginalization of the United States on the world stage. Equally sobering is that the vast majority of Americans are either ignorant of these developments or actually approve of them, bringing to mind the famous remark by Will Durant that "a great nation is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." Certainly, as one British colleague wrote me, the United States will be part of the future, but (he added) most of the future will take place outside of the United States. There is abundant evidence to indicate that our historical moment is passing, and that the zeitgeist, as it were, is moving on.<b>A sobering work that reveals that America has entered an inescapable social, cultural, and economic Dark Age.</b> <p> Historians now recognize that the fall of Rome, and the subsequent onset of the Dark Ages in Europe, cannot be ascribed to any single cause. The truth is that Rome no longer knew how to live; its decline was the result of a general malaise and structural weakness that grew over time. In <i>Dark Ages America</i>, Morris Berman argues that much the same can be said of the United States today. As religion triumphs over reason and democracy turns into plutocracy, the nation has entered a phase in its historical development from which there is no return. A particular strength of this book lies in the connections Berman makes between the large-scale processes of national collapse, such as an overextended economy and a self-destructive foreign policy, and the obvious deterioration of our daily lives: the frenzied acceleration of work, the erosion of integrity and community, and the impoverishment of the mass media. As the corporate-consumerist juggernaut that now defines the nation rolls on, removing meaning from our lives and leaving no real alternatives in its wake, the very factors that once propelled America to greatness--extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth--are now, paradoxically, the nails in our collective coffin. Like the citizens of ancient Rome, we too no longer know how to live; and within a few decades the United States will be marginalized on the world stage, its hegemony replaced by China or the European Union. </p><p> Our options at this point, Berman suggests, are two: to continue pursuing policies that are short-sighted and destructive, thereby guaranteeing a fairly rapid decline; or to attempt some slight modifications of these policies, thereby rendering that decline a bit more gradual. What is <i>not</i> an option is reversing this trajectory, for the levers of social and political change have effectively vanished from the scene. There is, in short, no rabbit to be pulled out of a hat here; our eclipse is a fait accompli.</p></p><h2>Algebra and Trigonometry</h2><p>Loose Leaf text copy of &#34;Algebra and Trigonometry Fourth Edition&#34; -- Brand New --</p><p></p><h2>The Illustrated Book of Fairy Tales</h2><p>More than fifty fairy tales from around the world--including such classics as &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; and &#34;Jack and the Beanstalk&#34;--are presented with full-color illustrations of the objects, peoples, and places of the tales, as well as historical and cultural information pertinent to each legend.</p><p>Grade 3-6?The idea of using tales from around the world to illustrate different themes (e.g., "Under a Spell," "True Love Conquers All") is interesting, but these selections are dull and unappealing. Most of the stories are popular and well known but the retellings are dry and missing that unique and subtle quality that brings folklore alive. "And the wolf leaped upon Little Red Riding Hood and gobbled her up" as a final sentence just falls flat. Throughout the narrative, sidebars illustrated with photos, drawings, and reproductions provide information about the folktales, their origins, where they might have taken place, and what makes them special. These tidbits are distracting and sometimes offer irrelevant facts. Does it matter in "Jack and the Beanstalk" that a modern harp would be heavy, 5.5 feet high, and difficult for Jack to carry down the beanstalk?

So when a private detective comes nosing around and asking questions, Reacher is not pleased. Especially when he later finds the guy dead. With his fingertips sliced off. Why was he so determined to find him? What does the vicious Wall Street honcho Hook Hobie have to do with it? And what about the reappearance of a woman from Reacher&#39;s own troubled past? &#34;Tripwire&#34; is a taut, nailbiting adventure which once again stars Lee Child&#39;s irresistible hero, the maverick former military policeman Jack Reacher.</p><p>Ex-military policeman Jack Reacher is lying low in Key West, digging up swimming pools by hand. He is not at all pleased when a private detective starts asking questions about him. But when the detective, Costello, turns up dead with his fingertips sliced off, Reacher realizes it is time to move on. <p> As in Lee Child's two previous thrillers, <i>Die Trying</i> and <i>Killing Floor</i>, Reacher is soon up to his neck in lethal trouble, this time involving a vicious Wall Street manipulator, a mysterious woman (of course), and the livelihood of a whole community. Even the fate of soldiers missing in action in Vietnam is stirred into the brew.</p><p> But this is not a book by one of the new breed of U.S. thriller writers. Child prides himself on his ability, as an Englishman, to write American thrillers that are utterly convincing in milieu and toughness of action, without a trace of English sensibility. <i>Tripwire</i> is no exception. Every bit as lean and compulsive as its predecessors, it also builds on the freshest aspect of those books: Reacher may be a tough, epic hero, but he always remains human and vulnerable. <i>--Barry Forshaw</i></p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Calling this book a companion volume to <i>A Jar of Tiny Stars: Poems by NCTE Award-Winning Poets</i> (1996), editor Bernice Cullinan explains why she wanted to focus on Fisher, who was one of the first winners of the NCTE award for poetry to children, and how these 41 poems were chosen. Excerpts from an article by Fisher and interviews provide an overall introduction, and there are short, personal statements preceding each thematic section. The poems are reprinted from earlier collections, such as <i>Always Wondering</i> (1991), <i>In One Door and Out the Other</i> (1969), and <i>A Cricket in the Thicket</i> (1963). Very approachable, they have the simplicity, grace, and childlike voice that are hallmarks of Fisher's verse. The black-and-white illustrations, though sometimes pleasing, add little to readers' enjoyment, and the dull, dark blue jacket with its silver seal of the National Council of Teachers of English appears to be designed for teachers rather than for children. Still, considering that Fisher's poems are in print primarily in anthologies that include other poets, libraries may want this volume of Fisher alone. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Kindergarten-Grade 5-Bernice Cullinan, a children's literature professor, and a panel of educators put together a list of Fisher's poems and sent them to teachers around the country. Children voted for their favorites, and those are the ones that make up this anthology. Sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, the selections speak from a child's perspective. In the introduction and in excerpts from an article originally published in Highlights for Children, Fisher allows glimpses into her own life as a child and poet, fascinated with the world around her. Emery's simple line drawings, reminiscent of Lillian Hoban's illustrations for Fisher's In One Door and Out the Other (Crowell, 1969; o.p.), are a pleasing accompaniment to the text. The poet's many collections and a list of the teachers and librarians who participated in the selection process are appended. If Fisher is popular in your library, you'll want to add this title to the poetry shelves.<br><i>Susan Oliver, Tampa-Hillsborough Public Library System, FL</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Gun Digest Book of Centerfire Rifles Assembly/Disassembly</h2><p>Cleaning, repairing &amp; maintaining your centerfire rifle has never been easier! <i>Gun Digest Book of Centerfire Rifles Assembly/Disassembly 3rd Edition</i> is the indispensable guide to DIY disassembly, repair and reassembly of today's most popular centerfire rifles.<br><br> Step-by-step disassembly and reassembly instructions cover 68 popular models and hundreds of closely related variants.

It was nothing like that in the 1930s. America was white and that was that. It didn't do you no good to dream of making it to the big time. It was impossible. And then, y'know, along came Jesse and along came Joe."</p><p> -- Ruth Owens, Jesse's late wife</p></blockquote><p>n the summer of 1935, within weeks of each other, Joe Louis and Jesse Owens emerged as the first black superstars of world sport, and their subsequent political and social impact on America was nothing short of sensational. To fans (and even critics) the world over, they seemed larger than life, and yet in their endeavors they were unfailingly human: as vulnerable as they were courageous; as troubled as they were brilliant; as unsettled in themselves as they are now fixed in history. </p><p>Scrupulously researched and written in spare, eloquent prose, Heroes Without a Country vividly re-creates some of the most dramatic sporting events of the past century. In August 1936, in front of Hitler and an imposing phalanx of Nazi commanders, Jesse Owens, "the fastest man on earth," won an unprecedented four medals at the Olympic Games in Berlin. Two years later, in "the fight of the century," his great friend Joe Louis crushed Germany's Max Schmeling to signal the end of white supremacy in boxing. Like Jesse, Joe had been born to black sharecropping parents in a country demeaned by racism; together their victories became a rallying point for the disenfranchised black population of America. Idolized across the world, they were two young men at the pinnacle of their careers who overcame prejudice and fear to achieve their goals. Yet for both of them, success brought its own perils. In 1938, two years after winning his gold medals in Berlin, Owens was hounded out of amateur sports by the infamously tyrannical Olympic boss "Slavery Avery" Brundage and, facing financial ruin, he was reduced to running for money against dogs, horses, and even his friend Joe Louis. Later the two would be subjected to FBI investigations, harassed by the IRS, and beleaguered by debt and despair. Jesse watched Joe slip into drug addiction and mental illness. </p><p>In <em>Heroes Without a Country,</em> award-winning writer Donald McRae captures the uncanny coincidences and intertwined events that bound these men together -- through both triumph and tragedy -- and provides an intimate and thought-provoking dual portrait of two of the most important athletes of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><p>Donald McRae is the acclaimed author of five nonfiction books, including <em>Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart</em> and <em>Heroes Without a Country: America's Betrayal of Joe Louis and Jesse Owens</em>. He is the only writer to have won the William Hill UK Sports Book of the Year Award twice. In 2005 he was named Feature Writer of the Year for his work in <em>The Guardian</em>. McRae lives near London with his family.</p>After learning that the Olympic track star Jesse Owens once raced against the legendary heavyweight champion Joe Louis, McRae, a freelance writer living in London, set out to find what prompted such an unlikely pairing and to trace the arc of the two men's lives. The result of McRae's research is a powerful and moving story that documents how these two black stars struggled to reconcile their fame and success in the sporting arena to the discrimination faced by black Americans across most parts of the country. The answer to why Owens raced Louis is simple-Owens needed the money and Louis was more than willing to help out his friend. After refusing to continue a barnstorming tour following the 1936 Olympics, Owens was banned from continuing his track-and-field career as an amateur and turned to other ways to cash in on his notoriety. Following the collapse of several promising ventures, Owens took to racing horses and working at other odd jobs. Louis had no problem earning money as a professional fighter, but he had trouble keeping it. He spent freely, paid large sums to his promoters and handlers, and ended up owing the IRS millions in back taxes. Despite their money woes (Owens's financial situation improved over the years), the men slowly worked to break down racial barriers, and for that they held a special place in the hearts of most black Americans. McRae evinces a deep appreciation for the burdens fame bestowed on Owens and Louis and shines a well-deserved spotlight on two of the most prominent Americans of the 20th century. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Average Joe: God&#39;s Extraordinary Calling to Ordinary Men</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;What is happening to my life?&#x201d;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Have you ever honestly asked yourself that question? As young boys, we dreamed of being pilots, firefighters, doctors, and cowboys. Now we&#x2019;re older, with a wonderful wife and kids, as well as a mortgage, a minivan, and a fulfilling but not-so-glamorous job. What happened? All the dreams that once inspired us have evaporated into traffic jams, computer screens, bills, and deadlines.

Life as an average Joe is once again about to start its familiar grind.<br><br>If you are like me, we go through the same&#x2014;often life-numbing&#x2014;motions every day. We crawl out of bed at 0-dark-thirty to the sound of a screaming alarm clock, then stub our toe on our kid&#x2019;s &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; Christmas gift&#x2014;the very one that last year cost us two days&#x2019; pay! The dog needs to go outside. The kids are asleep but will definitely need some &#x201c;dad time&#x201d; later. The washer that sprang a leak still needs repair. The milk in the fridge is sour. The next-door<br>neighbor parked his extra car in front of our driveway&#x2014;again.<br><br>Oh, man, this is not the life you and I probably thought we would live!<br><br>As a boy I certainly had bigger plans than working in a cramped cubicle from eight to five, building widgets on the late shift at the local mill, or flipping burgers at the corner diner. My boyhood dreams never included a mortgage, diapers, traffic tickets, or cleaning out the gutters. Perhaps, like you, I dreamed of saving a life, flying a fighter jet, finding a cure for cancer, or even walking on the moon. As boys, we had such high hopes to accomplish something great,<br><br>to make a difference, to live a life that left a mark on those around us. We marveled at men like Chuck Yeager, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and the Reverend Billy Graham. We wanted to ride like John Wayne, lead like Ronald Reagan, drive like Mario Andretti, and win like the 1973 Miami Dolphins. All of us longed to be James Bond; instead we ended up looking and acting a bit like Archie Bunker. Maybe you are asking the same question I ask: What happened to my life?<br><br>What happened for most of us is reality. Instead of finding fame and fortune, normalcy and &#x201c;never enough&#x201d; found us. We are average Joes, but is that really a problem? Definitely not! So-called average Joes are the ones who make the world work.<br><br>God seems to have a special fondness for average Joes. Before they accomplished extraordinary deeds, normal guys like Gideon, David, Peter, and Paul went about their farming, sheep herding, fishing, and tent making. Even Jesus, our Redeemer, Healer, and coming King, started out using a hammer and saw in a carpenter&#x2019;s shop.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll find average Joes are everywhere. Good men, honest men. They are hard working, genuine, and steadfast. More often than not, they are absent from the great halls of debate, the ivory towers of scholastic achievement, or the family trees of aristocracy. Instead they mow grass, sell insurance, build furniture, drive trucks, manage restaurants, and fix plumbing. They can be found serving coffee at the local diner, selling tires, or pastoring a small church. In our hurried pace we often pass them by as we rush off to our next appointment or event.<br><br>I suppose we might find an average Joe on Wall Street or in a government building in Washington DC, but if we did, he might be there only to fix, paint, or build something. Sometimes looked down upon, even dismissed as &#x201c;less than,&#x201d; average Joes are the stable, dependable, resolute backbone of an ever-so-wavering society.<br><br>In a day when compromise and political correctness rule, these simple men&#x2014;average Joes&#x2014;seek truth and have an unshakable commitment to doing what is right. Ask them their opinion, and you will get an earful of resolute beliefs in God, country, and family. Strong in character, integrity, and principle, these are the unsung heroes of everyday life in America.<br><br>Average Joes Make a Difference<br><br>Being an average Joe is awesome, and I&#x2019;m proud to call myself one. Too often, though, we average Joes feel ashamed of who we are. For some reason we don&#x2019;t seem to quite measure up. Why is that? What lies are we hearing and believing about our place in the world? Many in contemporary society want to tell us our average Joe life is irrelevant, maybe even inconsequential. What? Are you kidding me? Tell that to the son who thinks his dad is the greatest. Tell that to the wife who has such deep respect and love for a husband who, day in and day out, goes to work at an unglamorous, demanding job to ensure his family is fed and sheltered. In fact, tell that to a savior named Jesus who chose twelve average Joes to help Him change the world.<br><br>Who cares if a man ever rafts the Colorado River, plays college football, or makes a million dollars before he&#x2019;s forty? That guy may never leave that cubicle he calls home forty-plus hours a week. He may always drive a minivan, sell appliances, and live in a suburban tract house. Is he any less a man?<br><br>No way.<br><br>Labeled &#x201c;average,&#x201d; this Joe is that steadfast example of simple faith, honor, integrity, and character. He is the man who goes home at night to his wife and children. He mows the lawn, fixes the deck, reads to his kids, loves his wife, helps his friends, and serves his Lord. He&#x2019;s the kind of neighbor who will lend you his tools and watch your house when you&#x2019;re out of town. You trust him with your kids. He pays his bills and taxes. If he says he will be somewhere, he will be there&#x2014;and on time. He&#x2019;s got his problems, and he owns them. Quite simply, average Joe is the very best of who we are.<br><br>This book is a challenge to look deep within yourself, to better understand the man God has made you to be, to find contentment in the life God has blessed you with. I will urge you to finally let go of boyish or unrealistic dreams and replace them with the wise passions, wisdom, and discipline of a man. It&#x2019;s time to make sure that integrity, honor, and moral steadfastness describe who you are. Later in this book I will share some stories of average Joes that none of us will ever see on the front page or hear about on a cable news show. But in the world that really matters&#x2014;God&#x2019;s kingdom&#x2014;they are heroes of the faith, true examples of how God uses ordinary men to change the world.<br><br>Before we go on, I want to make something really clear: when I use the word average, I don&#x2019;t mean lazy, sloppy, inept, mediocre, or anything like that. A true average Joe works hard, give his all, makes a difference. And he does it without whining or feeling sorry for himself. An average Joe isn&#x2019;t expecting to get rich or famous. He&#x2019;s content knowing that the One whose opinion really counts is pleased with him.<br><br>While the world around us implies that we are nothing without fame, fortune, and recognition, we daily and without fanfare answer the call to perform the routine. As average Joes, we make a difference. The life we are living does have purpose, meaning, and honor.</p><h2>Meeting the Family (Ecce Romani, Level 1)</h2><p>Great traditional and educational work</p><p></p><h2>The Crossroad (Amish Country Crossroads #2)</h2><p>A Captivating Tale Set in the Heart of Amish Country!<p></p> <p>After the dramatic conclusion to his discovery of a long-lost postcard, journalist Philip Bradley simply cannot forget the Amish people he met while on assignment in Pennsylvania particularly Rachel Yoder and her young daughter, Annie.

Metal sculptor Tess Bajac's days are spent scrabbling through junkyards, scraping bucks together through odd jobs as a welder, and soldering poems in steel. Unlike many in the field, who shape abstracts out of found objects, Tess does her own welding. (Koja at times follows the imitative fallacy and welds scrap sentences into Burroughs-like cutup paragraphs that mimic her heroine's sculpture. Which can be hard on the reader.) Into Tess's life creeps Bibi, a dancer turned artist in body metal, blood, burns, scars, and pain. Tess longs for motion in her sculpture. Bibi brings it, making love-dances to the sharp-edged pieces that leave her ripped and bleeding. Together with some dirty young dudes and studs who are artists in explosives and weird soundtapes and strobe lights, they form a group called the Surgeons and put on Grand Guignol horror shows that make them famous among subcultures. Then Bibi's lover Paul is killed during one show, the Surgeons fold, and Bibi splits from Tess, who desponds. Later, even more beringed through all the lips on her body, Bibi returns and seduces Tess into her first lesbian tie. But Bibi is bent and invents endless injustices on Tess's part so that she can justify more scars, pain, and body metal. A strong stylist, Koja makes white-hot the pains of metal sculpting and draws a big picture of S&amp;M bars and byways before bringing on her big show as Bibi decides to go all the way and, with razor and scalpel, just about get out of her skin--or help a friend out of his. Beyond the styptic pencil and safety blades. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This humorless novel about art punks in an unnamed present-day city is long on form and short on content. The main character, Tess Bajac, is an earnest young sculptor who lives for her work, so much so that readers may well long for her to do something besides make anther sculpture. She does all too rarely. Tess meets Bibi Bloss, a fey dancer, and they establish Surgeons of the Demolition, a performance art troupe whose shows combine Tess's mobile, menacing, robotlike constructions with Bibi's dancers and much fake blood. Koja devotes endless pages to details of their productions, and the vicissitudes of the protagonists' relationship have to suffice for drama. Their main source of conflict is Bibi's growing compulsion to mortify her flesh via piercing, tattooing and scarification. Readers will find it hard to relate to such a rarefied concern, especially since the roots of Bibi's obsession are never explored. Koja ( The Cipher ) has a considerable talent for evoking atmosphere, but her style, an obscurantist mix of stark minimalism and florid gush, further distances the characters from the reader and hampers the novel's already minimal movement. The ending is merely a jarring, long-overdue bit of business; on the whole the novel, like the art of the characters it portrays, is a sustained exercise in style over substance. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Grieving the Loss of Someone You Love</h2><p>A collection of daily meditations to help the bereaved through the process of grief, offering spiritual and emotional consolation for those who have lost a relative or friend.</p><p>No valley is as vast as grief, no journey as personal and life-changing.

The book highlights the key role played by drawing in artistic teaching and in how artists studied the human body and the natural world. Aspects of regional difference, the development of new drawing techniques and classes of graphic work, such as finished presentation pieces to impress patrons, are also explored. An extended introduction focusing on how and why artists made drawings, with a special emphasis on the pivotal role of Leonardo, is richly illustrated with examples from the two collections that elucidate the technique and function of the works. This is followed by catalogue entries for just over 100 drawings where discussion of their function and significance is supported by comparative illustrations of related works, such as paintings.</p><p>Hugo Chapman is Curator of Italian Drawings before 1800 at the British Museum. He is author of Padua in the 1450s: Marco Zoppo and his Contemporaries (1998), Michelangelo Drawings: Closer to the Master (2005), and Michelangelo (2005). Marzia Faietti is Director of the Gabinetto Disegni e Stampe degli Uffizi in Florence. She has published widely on Old Master drawings and prints with a particular emphasis on 16th-century art from her native Emilia.&#39;This impressive book is not only a fine contribution to fifteenth-century Italian art studies, but is a notable achievement for the scholars and specialists involved. The nature of this volume will appeal to a broad range of readers, from scholars who will refer to it for its numerous specific historical details and comparative studies, to artists seeking visual inspiration and insight into method.&#39; --The Sixteenth Century Journal</p><h2>The don: The life and death of Sam Giancana</h2><p>The Life and Death of Sam Giancana fully documented in this riveting true story book about one of Chicago&#39;s famous mob figures.</p><p></p><h2>The Man In The High Castle (SFBC 50th Anniversary Collection)</h2><p>It is 1962 and the Second World War has been over for seventeen years: people have now had a chance to adjust to the new order. But it&#39;s not been easy. The Mediterranean has been drained to make farmland, the population of Africa has virtually been wiped out and America has been divided between the Nazis and the Japanese. In the neutral buffer zone that divides the two superpowers lives the man in the high castle, the author of an underground bestseller, a work of fiction that offers an alternative theory of world history in which the Axis powers didn&#39;t win the war. The novel is a rallying cry for all those who dream of overthrowing the occupiers. But could it be more than that? Subtle, complex and beautifully characterized, The Man in the High Castle remains the finest alternative world novel ever written, and a work of profundity and significance.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Samurai : A Novel</h2><p>A copy that has been read, but is in excellent condition. Pages are intact and not marred by notes or highlighting. The spine remains undamaged.\nCalled &#34;remarkable&#34; (The Wall Street Journal) and &#34;an ambitious, colossal debut novel&#34; (Publishers Weekly), Helen DeWitt&#39;s The Last Samurai is back in print at last\n\nHelen DeWitt&#39;s 2000 debut, The Last Samurai, was &#34;destined to become a cult classic&#34; (Miramax). The enterprising publisher sold the rights in twenty countries, so &#34;Why not just, &#39;destined to become a classic?&#39;&#34; (Garth Risk Hallberg) And why must cultists tell the uninitiated it has nothing to do with Tom Cruise?\n\nSibylla, an American-at-Oxford turned loose on London, finds herself trapped as a single mother after a misguided one-night stand. High-minded principles of child-rearing work disastrously well. J. S. Mill (taught Greek at three) and Yo Yo Ma (Bach at two) claimed the methods would work with any child; when these succeed with the boy Ludo, he causes havoc at school and is home again in a month. (Is he a prodigy, a genius? Readers looking over Ludo&#39;s shoulder find themselves easily reading Greek and more.) Lacking male role models for a fatherless boy, Sibylla turns to endless replays of Kurosawa&#39;s masterpiece Seven Samurai. But Ludo is obsessed with the one thing he wants and doesn&#39;t know: his father&#39;s name. At eleven, inspired by his own take on the classic film, he sets out on a secret quest for the father he never knew. He&#39;ll be punched, sliced, and threatened with retribution. He may not live to see twelve. Or he may find a real samurai and save a mother who thinks boredom a fate worse than death.</p><p>Helen DeWitt's extraordinary debut, <i>The Last Samurai</i>, centers on the relationship between Sibylla, a single mother of precocious and rigorous intelligence, and her son, who, owing to his mother's singular attitude to education, develops into a prodigy of learning. Ludo reads Homer in the original Greek at 4 before moving on to Hebrew, Japanese, Old Norse, and Inuit; studying advanced mathematical techniques (Fourier analysis and Laplace transformations); and, as the title hints, endlessly watching and analyzing Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, <i>The Seven Samurai</i>. But the one question that eludes an answer is that of the name of his father: Sibylla believes the film obliquely provides the male role models that Ludo's genetic father cannot, and refuses to be drawn on the question of paternal identity. The child thinks differently, however, and eventually sets out on a search, one that leads him beyond the certainties of acquired knowledge into the complex and messy world of adults.<p> The novel draws on themes topical and perennial--the hothousing of children, the familiar literary trope of the quest for the (absent) father--and as such, divides itself into two halves: the first describes Ludo's education, the second follows him in his search for his father and father figures. The first stresses a sacred, Apollonian pursuit of logic, precise (if wayward) erudition, and the erratic and endlessly fascinating architecture of languages, while the second moves this knowledge into the world of emotion, human ambitions, and their attendant frustrations and failures. </p><p> <i>The Last Samurai</i> is about the pleasure of ideas, the rich varieties of human thought, the possibilities that life offers us, and, ultimately, the balance between the structures we make of the world and the chaos that it proffers in return. Stylistically, the novel mirrors this ambivalence: DeWitt's remarkable prose follows the shifts and breaks of human consciousness and memory, capturing the intrusions of unspoken thought that punctuate conversation while providing tantalizing disquisitions on, for example, Japanese grammar or the physics of aerodynamics. It is remarkable, profound, and often very funny.

There are some outlandishly crude moments that belie what ends up being an achingly tender treatise on love and motherhood. It is a testament to July&#x2019;s skill as a storyteller that she is able to make you laugh, cringe, and cry from one page to the next, and not only sympathize with a very unlikely heroine, but actually relate to her.

A native of New York State, Ms. Kirkpatrick now lives with her husband and two daughters in Seattle, Washington.Grade 5-8&#x2013;In 1686, nine-year-old Daniel Bonnet's Huguenot family makes a desperate attempt to escape persecution in France. They board a ship that they believe will transport them to England. Instead, they have embarked on a three-year journey that takes them first to Africa, where the vessel takes on a cargo of slaves. Daniel's leg wound from a French soldier's bayonet renders him handicapped yet he performs chores that lead him into the ship's hold, where he meets Seynabou, a girl kidnapped into slavery. In Guadeloupe, he manages to bring her to the attention of a Huguenot sugar plantation owner, who buys her. But even here, French colonial soldiers arrest Huguenots, and families and their slaves leave for New York, where they earn money to buy land and establish a community in New Rochelle. Kirkpatrick creates a strong sense of place, and the plot successfully comes full circle as the Bonnets return to their original trade as weavers. Full-page illustrations are scattered throughout. Back matter includes a pronunciation guide and glossary in English and French as well as a historical note that includes a passage about the real Daniel Bonnet. This strong historical novel presents a realistic account of slavery, religious intolerance, and French immigration in Colonial times.<i>&#x2013;Jean Gaffney, Dayton and Montgomery County Public Library, Miamisburg, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I&#39;m not going to teach you how to survive in snowy mountains for a month with only one tea-bag or how to kill a room fill of people with only a toothpick. There are plenty of books that do that already. This book will teach you how to fight and survive war in the 21st century from the tools of the trade, to avoiding getting shot or blown-up, from surviving an interrogation to defending a position. This is a book not for the faint hearted. But then neither is war.</p><p>At the age of 16, Robert Stirling joined the British Army and spent his first year of service undergoing a strict training regime designed to prepare a soldier for leadership. Entering adult service and passing P Company, the Parachute Regiment selection, led to four tours in Northern Ireland and some covert experience; he was probably the second youngest ever to pass selection for the SAS at 19 years of age. Robert left the British Army and joined the Rhodesian Army towards the end of the Bush War. Here he led a unit of 200 men including a number of ex-French Foreign Legionnaires. Besides extensive combat experience in numerous conflicts, Robert has been contracted to recover stolen diamonds, work undercover against mercenary operations, teach unarmed combat to riot police, and provide close protection to VIPs and other secretive roles. Based in Southern Spain, he travels widely and accepts some consultancy work. He has recently trained the Austrian Officer Corps and Special Forces in unarmed combat and the Greek Special Forces.

To Devera the Wanderer, it's a pretty toy to play with. To Vlad Taltos, it's a handy prop for a con he's running. To the Empire, it's a tool to be used against their greatest enemies&#x2015;the Jenoine.

A native of Minneapolis, he currently lives in Texas.</p><br>&nbsp;<br>The first time I saw the tiassa was nine Real Years before I was born. Mafenyi was holding it, and it was so pretty! When I saw it again, two hundred Real Years earlier, I had to take it so I did.<br>I didn&#x2019;t think Mafenyi would mind too much. She hadn&#x2019;t made it to keep. She told me that she made it because she had to, but it shouldn&#x2019;t ever stay with anyone for too long. She used silver that came all the way from Aelma, which is a city on the Chareq River near some mountains called Daeld, which is where the silver was found in the ground.<br>Mafenyi said she melted the silver in a cauldron made of light, and she cut off her hand and put it in the cauldron, and plucked out one of her eyes and put that in, too, and then shaped it while it was still hotter than hot. She worked on it for years and years, so the ears would be so perfect, and you could see candlelight through the wings; she put tiny sapphires in for the eyes. I asked her how come she still had both hands and both eyes, and she said she was a Goddess and so she grew them back. She said I could be a Goddess if I wanted to be, and I said my grandmother was a Goddess and it didn&#x2019;t seem like much fun.<br>When we were done talking I went away, but then I came back. I wanted to just look at it some more, but she was sleeping, and that&#x2019;s when I knew I had to have it, so I took it from her shelf.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t big, but it was so heavy I had to hold it in both hands. I went back home and just held it and looked at it, but I got fingerprints on it so I cleaned it off, and then wrapped it in cloth. I kept it in the cloth after that except when I wanted to look at it.<br>There was a woman named Chuvin. She was an Athyra, and she was very nice. I thought she should have the tiassa, so I left it in her house, then I went off to see a new world being made, which was very exciting.<br>When I got back, I went to look at the silver tiassa, but Chuvin didn&#x2019;t have it anymore. She had made some very pretty psiprints, though, and I got to see them. She gave me one of Yevetna Falls that&#x2019;s so good you can almost get wet looking at it. Mommy said that first, but I think it&#x2019;s funny and true, so I&#x2019;m saying it now. I asked Chuvin what she did with the tiassa, but she said she didn&#x2019;t know, it just got lost somehow.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t hard to find it, though. When you looked in what the Necromancer calls the other place, it was like a big white light, with two blinking blue thingies. I saw it right away, and followed it because I wanted to know where it was, and really I just wanted to see it again. It isn&#x2019;t hard to follow something in the other place, but it&#x2019;s hard to talk about. It&#x2019;s like painting when you don&#x2019;t have paint, or singing when there&#x2019;s no song, or talking when there are no words. I can&#x2019;t explain. Anyway, I followed it.<br>It was an old man who had it. He was a Lyorn and his name was Pindua. He made statues from big pieces of marble. I got to hold the tiassa for a little while, but then I left it with him. He made one called &#x201c;Worill Reclining on Stairway&#x201d; that they put in the Hall of Monuments in the Imperial Palace.<br>A little while after he made it he died and they brought him to the Paths of the Dead. He owed a lot of money when he died, and when that happens they sell all your things to try to pay the people you owe money to, so the tiassa was sold to a man named Paarfi who was a Hawk and who wrote books.<br>I didn&#x2019;t think about it for a long time, but then I remembered it one day a year later, which was almost three hundred Real Years later. I looked for it, and Paarfi still had it. I went to talk to him about it. He talked about what he was writing. He was a nice man.<br>I told him he should give the tiassa away, and he agreed, but said he wanted to keep it a little longer, until he finished his new book. I said that was okay, and he gave me one of his books and signed it for me. He wrote, &#x201c;To Devera, a very special little girl.&#x201d; I took it to Grandma&#x2019;s and put it in the chest with my things, next to the seashell that whistles &#x201c;March to the Kaanas&#x201d; and the psiprint of Yevetna Falls and the tick-ticker and some other stuff I want to keep.<br>While I was there, Grandma asked me what I was doing, and I said I was looking for the silver tiassa and she asked what that was so I explained where it came from. She asked some questions about it, but she had the look she gets when she&#x2019;s being nice and doesn&#x2019;t really care about what you&#x2019;re telling her, so pretty soon I said good-bye and ran off.<br>I went to a place called Tanvir where it was just spring and there were flowers in all the colors there are. After that, I went to an empty tower in a dead city and a man made of metal played music for me. After a while, I started wanting to see the tiassa again, so I went back to fifty Real Years later, and Paarfi still had it. I thought it was long enough, so I took it but left him a note, then I went to Adrilankha ten Real Years ahead and played with Vlad Norathar. I showed him how to look in the other place, and he showed me how to make a spinnystick with glitters.<br>Then I was tired from all the jumping around so I put my spinnystick in the chest and took a nap. Mommy says naps are good for you, but I only take them when I&#x2019;m sleepy. When I woke up again I found Daddy and showed him the tiassa and he said it was very pretty. I asked if he was ever going to come visit me and Mommy and he said he would soon because he wanted his sword back. He looked angry when he said it so I didn&#x2019;t ask about it any more. While I was there Mafenyi came up and said I shouldn&#x2019;t have stolen the tiassa and had to give it back and Daddy told her not to accuse me of stealing but I said I had just borrowed it to give to some people who needed it. They started arguing with each other so I left and took the tiassa with me.<br>I started to Mommy&#x2019;s but then a while later I looked in the other place, and saw Mafenyi was coming after me. I hadn&#x2019;t thought she wanted the tiassa that much. I thought about jumping, but then I could never come back to now. I didn&#x2019;t want to go to Grandma&#x2019;s, because then she would fight Mafenyi and I&#x2019;d feel bad, and if I went to Mommy&#x2019;s I&#x2019;d have to explain what I did.<br>So please, Uncle Vlad.

Returning to New York, where he grew up, he takes a room at a hotel and wonders what, well into middle age as he is, he should do next. It's not a question of money; it's a question of purpose, maybe of pride. In the company of an arch young poet, Michael, Asher revisits the streets and tenements of the Lower East Side where he spent his childhood, though little remains of THE past. Michael introduces him to Aurora, perhaps his girlfriend, who, to Asher's surprise, seems bent on pursuing him, too. Soon the older man and his edgy young companions are caught up in a slow, strange, almost ritualized dance of deceit and desire. <br>The End of Me, a successor to In Love and Her Face for the World to See, can be seen as the final panel of a triptych in which Alfred Hayes anatomizes, with a cool precision and laconic lyricism that are all his own, the failure of modern love. The last scene is the starkest of all.</p><p><b>Alfred Hayes</b> (1911-1985) was born into a Jewish family in Whitechapel, London, though his father, a barber, trained violinist, and sometime bookie, moved the family to New York when Hayes was three. After attending City College, Hayes worked as a reporter for the New York American and Daily Mirror and began to publish poetry, including "Joe Hill," about the legendary labor organizer, which was later set to music by the composer Earl Robinson and recorded by Joan Baez. During World War II Hayes was assigned to a special services unit in Italy; after the war he stayed on in Rome, where he contributed to the story development and scripts of several classic Italian neorealist films, including Roberto Rossellini's <i>Pais�</i> (1946) and Vittorio De Sica's <i>Bicycle Thieves</i> (1948), and gathered material for two popular novels, <i>All Thy Conquests</i> (1946) and <i>The Girl on the Via Flaminia</i> (1949), the latter the basis for the 1953 film <i>Act of Love</i>, starring Kirk Douglas. In the late 1940s Hayes went to work in Hollywood, writing screenplays for <i>Clash by Night</i>, <i>A Hatful of Rain</i>, <i>The Left Hand of God</i>, <i>Joy in the Morning</i>, and Fritz Lang's <i>Human Desire</i>, as well as scripts for television. Hayes was the author of seven novels, a collection of stories, and three volumes of poetry.

But as Pierre Bayard finds in this dazzling reinvestigation of <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, sometimes the master missed his mark. Using the last thoughts of the murder victim as his key, Bayard unravels the case, leading the reader to the astonishing conclusion that Holmes &#x2013; and, in fact, Arthur Conan Doyle &#x2013; got things all wrong: The killer is not at all who they said it was.</p><p>Part intellectual entertainment, part love letter to crime novels, and part crime novel in itself, <i>Sherlock Holmes Was Wrong</i> turns one of our most beloved stories delightfully on its head. Examining the many facets of the case and illuminating the bizarre interstices between Doyle's fiction and the real world, Bayard demonstrates a whole new way of reading mysteries: a kind of "detective criticism" that allows readers to outsmart not only the criminals in the stories we love, but also the heroes &#x2015; and sometimes even the writers.</p></p><p><p><b>Pierre Bayard</b> is a professor of French literature at the University of Paris VIII and a psychoanalyst. He is the author of <i>How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read, Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?,</i> and many other books.</p>French literature professor and psychoanalyst Bayard (<i>How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read</i>) returns to the close reading and iconoclastic analysis of classic detective fiction he did in <i>Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?</i> with this audacious revisionist view of one of the best-known mysteries of all time. As always, Bayard playfully counters the ways literary academics read with the way real people read as he explains his theory of detective criticism. Arguing that Sherlock Holmes often drew false conclusions, Bayard picks apart the apparently airtight case Holmes assembled in <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> and offers an alternative solution. He goes a step further than with the Agatha Christie whodunit by suggesting that Holmes erred in his identification not only of the murderer but of the murder victim. Readers may be more impressed with Bayard's cleverness than his tongue-in-cheek arguments, but his logic will lead many to hope that his opinion on who really killed Hamlet's father (in <i>Enqu�te sur Hamlet</i>) will be translated into English as well. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But with the growing recognition that the Earth&#x2019;s surface had not been created once and for all but was slowly evolving, mountains came to be seen as the unexplored text of the Earth&#x2019;s story&#x2014;a terrain that scientists, adventurers, naturalists, and, finally, travelers began to explore. In <b>Mountains of the Mind</b>, Robert Macfarlane blends cultural history, meditation, and memoir to show how early geologists helped transform our perceptions of the wild, chaotic landscapes; how the allure of height increasingly drew fearless climbers, culminating in the romantic figure of George Mallory, the passionate Englishman who died on Mount Everest in 1924; and how the elemental beauty of snow and ice coalesced into an aesthetic of the sublime.<br>Mountains of the Mind is at once an enthralling work of history, an intimate account of Macfarlane&#x2019;s own experiences, and a beautifully written meditation on how memory, landscape, imagination, and the landscape of mountains are joined together in our minds and under our feet.</p><p>Robert Macfarlane was born in 1976. He is a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and he contributes to the Observer, the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, and the <i>London Review of Books</i>, among other publications. <b>Mountains of the Mind</b> is his first book.Mountains haven't always been viewed as magnificent tests of bravery or even as scenic vacation spots-only in the last few centuries have Westerners found them worthy of attention. As British writer Macfarlane (the London Review of Books; the Times Literary Supplement) points out, "until well into the 1700s, travelers who had to cross the Alpine passes often chose to be blindfolded," sparing themselves the terrors of the view. His point throughout this strangely compelling volume is that our attitudes toward mountains are very much a cultural product, a rich mix of theological, geological, artistic and social forces. With the development of geological science in the early 1800s, mountains, once viewed as "giant souvenirs of humanity's sinfulness," came to be seen as part of the earth's historical record. Recognized as "the great stone book" of history, mountains opened a window into "deep time," a glimpse of eternity. The thrill of vertigo, the infatuation with the unknown, the Social Darwinist challenge of the survival of the fittest, the march of British imperialism, even advances in cartography-all shaped the social imagination of mountains. As Western adventurers were increasingly lured from the Swiss Alps to the Himalayas, Macfarlane closes his study with the ill-fated Mallory expeditions to Everest, so mythic they almost defy analysis. The book itself is rather like some idiosyncratic, hand-drawn map of terra incognita. But for romantic, mountain-struck readers, Macfarlane's rich thoughts may make snow clouds clear, revealing new peaks and new wonders.

Learn more at CarlaNeggers.com."What do you think a private investigator would want me to stock in his fridge and pantry?"<br><br>The provocative question came from Ruby O'Dunn, up front by the cash register at the Swift River Country Store, a fixture in Knights Bridge, Massachusetts, for at least a century. Ruby was speaking to Christopher Sloan, a local firefighter. Kylie Shaw, out of sight in the wine section, had spotted them coming into the store. Now she wished she'd been paying closer attention to their conversation. Private investigator? What private investigator?<br><br>"He's from Beverly Hills," Chris said. "I'd start with that."<br><br>"He works for a Beverly Hills law firm. I don't know if he's actually from Beverly Hills."<br><br>"Close enough."<br><br>"It'd almost be easier if we were having him stay with my mother. She's got a fully stocked kitchen."<br><br>"She also has goats."<br><br>"Don't get me started. I cleaned out their stalls this morning. It's bedlam at her place. Even staying there a few days would be a lot to ask. Moss Hill is a much better choice."<br><br>Kylie held tight to a bottle of expensive champagne.<br><br><em>Moss Hill?</em><br><br>Moss Hill was a former nineteenth-century hat factory that had undergone extensive renovations and opened in March, with offices, meeting space and residences. She'd moved into one of its four loft-style apartments five weeks ago. So far, she was the only tenant. She accepted that the other three apartments wouldn't stay empty, but she hadn't ever&#x2014;not once&#x2014;imagined a private investigator moving in, even temporarily.<br><br>She missed what Chris said in response to Ruby. Ruby went on about wild mushrooms, artisan cheese and artichokes, but Chris finally told her to focus on basics. "Put a six-pack in the fridge," he said. "It'll be fine."<br><br>Ruby muttered something Kylie couldn't make out, and Chris left, apparently with a six-pack of his own.<br><br>Kylie placed the champagne in her basket. She'd promised herself she would take time to celebrate once the daffodils were in bloom, and they were definitely in bloom. The last time she'd come up for air and tried to celebrate had been in August. She'd ended up at a Red Sox game with a negative, burned-out carpenter who complained for seven innings. She'd been relieved when the game didn't go into extra innings and had told him she'd had a call from her sister, a veterinary student at Tufts, to get out of going back to Knights Bridge with him. Before that, she'd split a bottle of wine with a condescending sculptor in Paris, celebrating her first children's book as both author and illustrator. <em>These little children's drawings you do are sweet, Kylie, but...</em> He'd shrugged, leaving her to imagine the rest of what he was pretending to be too polite to say. She couldn't make a living as an illustrator, they weren't real art, they weren't any good, anyone could do it. It had been that kind of <em>but.</em><br><br>She headed to the cash register with her basket. She could always have her champagne alone on her balcony and toast the stars and the moon, with gratitude.<br><br>Maybe invite the Beverly Hills PI.<br><br>That'd be the day. She didn't plan to do anything to invite his scrutiny.<br><br>Ruby was lifting a basket off a stack by the register. Kylie had met all four O'Dunn sisters around town&#x2014;the country store, the library, the town offices where their mother worked&#x2014;but didn't know any of them well. She'd moved to Knights Bridge last summer and kept telling herself she wanted to get to know people there, but so far, they remained acquaintances, not friends. Ruby and Ava, fraternal twins and the youngest O'Dunns, were theater graduate students, Ava in New York, Ruby in Boston. A natural redhead like her three sisters, Ruby had dyed her hair plum-black and tied it back with a bright pink scarf. She wore a long black skirt, a white T-shirt and a denim jacket, with black boots and no jewelry.<br><br>"Oh, Kylie, hi," Ruby said. "I didn't see you back there."<br><br>"I couldn't resist the wine sale."<br><br>"Ah. Champagne, I see. Excellent. Did you hear Chris Sloan and me talking just now? A private investigator will be here from California tomorrow. He'll be staying in the apartment across the hall from you."<br><br>"What's he investigating?"<br><br>"One of his clients is giving a master class at Moss Hill next Saturday," Ruby said. "Daphne Stewart&#x2014;she has roots in town."<br><br>"She was here last September for the vintage fashion show at the library," Kylie said. "Hollywood costume designer. I remember."<br><br>"Did you go?"<br><br>"No, I didn't." She'd been fiddling with a project ahead of hitting the Send button. Work was always her excuse for not being more social. "I heard it was a great success."<br><br>"The fashion show raised a lot of money for the library and the historical society." Ruby hooked her basket on one arm. "Daphne's a character. Russ Colton&#x2014;the private investigator arriving tomorrow&#x2014;is making sure everything's set for her arrival. It'll be Moss Hill's first public event. You should come, Kylie. You'll be right there."<br><br>"Thanks. I'll give it some thought."<br><br>Ruby held up her basket. "I need to fill this up. I should get moving. Good to see you."<br><br>"You, too," Kylie said, but Ruby had spotted someone she knew and taken off down the canned-goods aisle.<br><br>Kylie set her basket on the counter.<br><br>A private investigator and a respected, longtime Hollywood costume designer on their way to town&#x2014;to Moss Hill.<br><br><em>Just what I need.</em><br><br>She held back a groan. If she couldn't fake excitement, best to be neutral.<br><br>She unloaded her groceries. In addition to the champagne, she'd picked up plain yogurt, cheddar cheese, flax-seed bread, coffee and mixed spring greens, all local to her quiet part of New England, west of Boston.<br><br>After paying for her groceries, she stepped outside. The beautiful April afternoon greeted her like a warm smile from a friend. She took in the quaint, picturesque village center. She was standing on Main Street, opposite the common, an oval-shaped green surrounded by classic houses, the library, churches, the town hall and a handful of small businesses. The long winter had released its grip. The grass was green, the trees were leafing out, and daffodils were in bloom. She had been working nonstop for weeks&#x2014;months&#x2014;and getting out into the warm spring air felt remarkably good, almost as if she'd come to life herself.<br><br>She noticed dark-haired, broad-shouldered Christopher Sloan farther down Main Street. He was the fifth of the six Sloan siblings, with four older brothers. She couldn't imagine having five brothers. She didn't have any brothers. The O'Dunns and the Sloans and other families had lived in Knights Bridge for decades, even for generations. Ruby and Chris had grown up together. That created bonds and a familiarity that Kylie couldn't pretend to have in her adopted town.<br><br>Or want.<br><br>Not now at least.<br><br>She arranged her groceries in her bike bags, aware of a vague uneasiness about the arrival of a private investigator at Moss Hill. It wasn't just that she wasn't thrilled about it. She'd worked hard not to draw attention to herself during her months in Knights Bridge.<br><br>But it would all work out, she told herself as she climbed on to her bike. She had champagne, food and coffee. If she so much as sensed this Russ Colton was going to cause trouble for her, she could hide out in her apartment for days, content in her world of evil villains, handsome princes and daring princesses.<br><br>Moss Hill was quiet even for a Saturday afternoon. Kylie's mud-spattered Mini was the only vehicle in the parking lot, so new it didn't have a single pit or pothole. She could feel the ten-mile round-trip ride in her thighs as she jumped off her bike. She'd relished the slight breeze and the fresh scents of spring in the air on this warmest day of the year so far.<br><br>She grabbed her groceries out of her bike bags and gave them a quick check. Somehow she'd managed not to break or spill anything. She started to slip her phone into her jacket pocket but saw she had a voice mail.<br><br>Her sister, Lila, three years younger, still hard at work as a veterinary student in Boston. Also still a chronic worrier who was convinced her only sibling was turning into a recluse.<br><br>Kylie listened to the message, smiling at its predictability. "I hope you're not answering because you're off having a great time with friends. Call back whenever. Just saying hi."<br><br>Lila had known at four that she wanted to be a veterinarian like their father. She'd never wavered. Kylie had always been more interested in drawing pictures of the animals that came in and out of the Shaw clinic than in operating on them.<br><br>She hadn't been out with friends. She'd missed her sister's call because she'd turned off her phone while she was on her bike.<br><br>She'd call Lila back later.<br><br>Kylie left her bike on the rack by the front entrance and followed a breezeway to the residential building, the smaller of the two brick-faced structures that formed the mill, or at least what remained of its original complex. Built in 1860 to capitalize on the burgeoning market for palm-leaf straw hats, the renovated mill was situated on a small river on the outskirts of town. Its namesake rose up across the road.<br><br>Moss Hill was one of the many knobs and hills that formed the uplands that had helped make the region attractive as a source of drinking water for metropolitan Boston. The bowl-shaped Swift River Valley had caught the eye of engineers and politicians, and the massive Quabbin Reservoir was created in the decades prior to World War II. Four small towns were disincorporated, their populations relocated, their homes and businesses razed, their graves and monuments moved, and Windsor Dam and Goodnough Dike were built, blocking the flow of three branches of the Swift River and Beaver Brook and, through the 1940s, allowing the valley to flood.<br><br>Even before Quabbin, the mill had been in decline, little realistic hope for its future. Straw hats had been going out of fashion, and by 1930, the mill stopped producing them. Subsequent owners hadn't succeeded with alternative businesses. Eventually, the old buildings were boarded up and abandoned. A few years ago, a local architect and his business partners had bought the property and begun the painstaking process of demolition, renovation and refurbishment.<br><br>Kylie took the industrial-style stairs to the second floor. In addition to its four apartments, the building included a well-equipped exercise room, lounge and lower-level parking and storage. Although she'd grown up in the western exurbs of Boston, she'd never heard of Knights Bridge until a friend, an art professor recently hired by the University of Iowa, had told her about her country house. <em>You need a place to work for a few months, and I need a renter until I figure out what to do.</em><br><br>Kylie had only meant to stay in Knights Bridge three months&#x2014;long enough to catch up on work and clear her head. But three months had turned into six, then eight, and when her friend decided to sell the house because Iowa was just too far away, she had taken a look at Moss Hill.<br><br>She'd been captivated by the transformation of the old mill and had surprised herself when she fell in love with her second-floor loft-style apartment. She'd loved the house she'd been renting, too. Charming, quiet and romantic, it had cried out for kids, dogs, chickens&#x2014;a family.<br><br>She unlocked her door and went inside, relaxing now that she was back in her space. She set her groceries on the counter in the kitchen area. She was only a little more than a month into living here, but the open layout suited her. Tall ceilings, arched floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the river, brick and white-painted walls and gleaming wood floors combined old and new, the specialty, she'd come to learn, of the owner and architect, Mark Flanagan. He'd thought of everything to make the space comfortable, contemporary and efficient. His wife, who worked at a local sawmill owned by her family, had helped with the finishing touches.<br><br>Since her previous rental had come furnished, Kylie had been scrambling to get things pulled together for this place. A buttery-leather sectional had been delivered a week ago, and she'd finally given up a ratty futon she'd dragged out of her parents' basement and bought a decent bed, queen-size with washed-linen sheets. She hated scratchy sheets.<br><br>She'd brought her worktable with her. She'd made it herself in college out of a finished birch-wood door on trestles, and it had gone with her almost everywhere since then. Not Paris or London; she'd left it in storage then.<br><br>She put the champagne in the refrigerator. She needed something concrete to celebrate before she opened it. It didn't have to be big, but it had to be more than daffodils being in bloom. That felt forced.<br><br><em>Because it is forced,</em> she thought.<br><br>She put away the rest of her groceries and flopped on the couch, tugging the clip out of her hair, which, despite being pulled back, was tangled from her bike ride. It was pale blond and past her shoulders, and she kept promising herself she would get to a hair salon. She was okay with a pair of scissors and could manage a quick trim, but she wasn't a pro.<br><br>Too restless to sit for long, she got to her feet, yanking off the lightweight jacket she'd worn into town. She kicked off her shoes and walked in her stocking feet to her worktable. She'd been working on <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> for only a few days. It was the third in a series of fairy tales she was illustrating. She'd finished <em>Hansel and Gretel</em> and <em>Sleeping Beauty.</em><br><br>She knew it would take some effort to get her into the world of a clever wolf, a dark forest and an adventurous girl with a picnic basket.<br><br>Kylie sank onto her chair, feeling unsettled, strangely out of her element. Had she made a mistake moving here?<br><br>But she knew she hadn't. As fantastic as it was, the house she'd rented had made her think about what she didn't have. This place worked fine, given her solitary ways and her bad luck with men.</p><h2>The Great War In The Air: Military Aviation from 1909 to 1921 (Smithsonian History of Aviation Series)</h2><p>A comprehensive study of the development and significance of airpower in World War I, comparing various military, political, technological, industrial, and cultural aspects of airpower in the major combatant powers, and discussing aviators&#39; lives and their attitudes toward aerial combat. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Aimed at the general reader as well as the specialist, Morrow's history of the development and significance of airpower during WW I will be considered definitive. He compares the military, technological and industrial aspects in the air services of the major powers--France, Germany, England, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the U.S.--and reveals how, by means of superior production (particularly French aero-engine manufacture), the Allies prevailed in the air war. Extensively researched, the study traces the increasingly important role of aviation in the 1914-1918 conflict, first in rendering ground forces more effective through air reconnaissance and artillery observation and later in air-to-air combat, bombing and strafing. Morrow, a history professor at the University of Georgia, carries his narrative past the Armistice to describe the postwar demobilization of the air services and contraction of the aviation industry, highlighting the impact of the war on the future of air power. Photos. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Organized year by year, Morrow's encyclopedic examination of aviation's part in World War I concentrates on aircraft engine and airframe production, moving from the slow and frail craft suitable only for artillery spotting to the fleets of fast and durable aircraft that swarmed through the skies at the war's end, their superior numbers meaning victory for the Allies. The approach of the author (history, Univ. of Georgia) is academic, but the emotional content of contemporary accounts rises to the surface now and then with excerpts of letters and other sources to put a human face on this brutal use of an infant technology. This is a serious yet readable history of this vital part of the conflict, meant for any reader with an interest in the early years of aviation.<br><i>- Mel D.

It is a story that spans 13,000 years of human history, beginning when Stone Age hunter-gatherers constituted the entire human population. Guns, Germs, and Steel is a world history that really is a history of all the world&#39;s peoples, a unified narrative of human life.</p><p>Explaining what William McNeill called <i>The Rise of the West</i> has become the central problem in the study of global history. In <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> Jared Diamond presents the biologist's answer: geography, demography, and ecological happenstance. Diamond evenhandedly reviews human history on every continent since the Ice Age at a rate that emphasizes only the broadest movements of peoples and ideas. Yet his survey is binocular: one eye has the rather distant vision of the evolutionary biologist, while the other eye--and his heart--belongs to the people of New Guinea, where he has done field work for more than 30 years.11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Weatherman</h2><p>John Mitchell and J. Edgar Hoover have declared Weatherpeople to be outlaws in America and have mobilized the vast police powers of the state against them. Nevertheless, Weatherman carries out its underground activities with relative impunity: as the level of repression has grown, so too has the number and sophistication of Weatherman bombings. And this is likely to continue. This book is about these mother country revolutionaries. It describes and analyzes who they are, how they emerged, the actions they have taken, and the nature of their politics. The first complete picture of Weatherman in the words of those who theorized, those who acted and those who watched it all - from the SDS split in June of 1969 to the bombings in June, 1970. Selected by Harold Jacobs, who provides his own analysis, the book includes the original Weather-statement, photographs of Weatherman actions, and articles by Eldridge Cleaver, Tom Hayden, Andrew Kopkind, David Horowitz, Carl Oglesby, I. F. Stone, Bernadine Dohrn and many more.</p><p></p><h2>Girl Meets Boy: The Myth of Iphis (Myths)</h2><p>Girl meets boy. It&#39;s a story as old as time. But what happens when an old story meets a brand new set of circumstances? Ali Smith&#39;s re-mix of Ovid&#39;s most joyful metamorphosis is a story about the kind of fluidity that can&#39;t be bottled and sold. It is about girls and boys, girls and girls, love and transformation, a story of puns and doubles, reversals and revelations. Funny and fresh, poetic and political, Girl meets boy is a myth of metamorphosis for the modern world.</p><p>ALI SMITH&#39;S first book, Free Love, won the Saltire First Book Award. She is also the author of Like (1997); Other Stories And Other Stories (1999); Hotel World (2001), which was shortlisted for both the Orange Prize and the Booker Prize, and won the Encore Award; The Whole Story and Other Stories (2003) and The Accidental (2005), which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and the Orange Prize and won the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award.I<br>Let me tell you about when I was a girl, our grandfather says.<br><br>It is Saturday evening; we always stay at their house on Saturdays. The couch and the chairs are shoved back against the walls. The teak coffee table from the middle of the room is up under the window. The floor has been cleared for the backward and forward somersaults, the juggling with oranges and eggs, the how-to-do-a-cartwheel, how-to-stand-on-your-head, how-to-walk-on-your-hands lessons. Our grandfather holds us upside-down by the legs until we get our balance. Our grandfather worked in a circus before he met and married our grandmother. He once did headstands on top of a whole troupe of headstanders. He once walked a tightrope across the Thames. The Thames is a river in London, which is five hundred and twenty-seven miles from here, according to the mileage chart in the RAC book in among our father&#x2019;s books at home. Oh, across the Thames, was it? our grandmother says. Not across the falls at Niagara? Ah, Niagara, our grandfather says. Now that was a whole other kittle of fish.<br><br>It is after gymnastics and it is before Blind Date. Sometimes after gymnastics it is The Generation Game instead. Back in history The Generation Game was our mother&#x2019;s favourite programme, way before we were born, when she was as small as us. But our mother isn&#x2019;t here any more, and anyway we prefer Blind Date, where every week without fail a boy chooses a girl from three girls and a girl chooses a boy from three boys, with a screen and Cilla Black in between them each time. Then the chosen boys and girls from last week&#x2019;s programme come back and talk about their blind date, which has usually been awful, and there is always excitement about whether there&#x2019;ll be a wedding, which is what it&#x2019;s called before people get divorced, and to which Cilla Black will get to wear a hat. <br><br>But which is Cilla Black, then, boy or girl? She doesn&#x2019;t seem to be either. She can look at the boys if she wants; she can go round the screen and look at the girls. She can go between the two sides of things like a magician, or a joke. The audience always laughs with delight when she does it.<br><br>You&#x2019;re being ridiculous, Anthea, Midge says shrugging her eyes at me.<br><br>Cilla Black is from the sixties, our grandmother says as if that explains everything.<br><br>It is Saturday tea-time, after supper and before our bath. It is always exciting to sit in the chairs in the places they usually aren&#x2019;t. Midge and I, one on each knee, are on our grandfather&#x2019;s lap and all three of us are wedged into the pushed-back armchair waiting for our grandmother to settle. She drags her own armchair closer to the electric fire. She puts her whole weight behind the coffee table and shoves it over so she can watch the football results. You don&#x2019;t need the sound up for that. Then she neatens the magazines on the under-rack of the table and then she sits down. Steam rises off teacups. We&#x2019;ve got the taste of buttered toast in our mouths. At least, I assume we all have it, since we&#x2019;ve all been eating the same toast, well, different bits of the same toast. Then I start to worry. Because what if we all taste things differently? What if each bit of toast tastes completely different? After all, the two bits I&#x2019;ve eaten definitely tasted a bit different even from each other. I look round the room, from head to head of each of us. Then I taste the taste in my own mouth again.<br><br>So did I never tell you about the time they put me in jail for a week when I was a girl? our grandfather says.<br><br>What for? I say.<br><br>For saying you were a girl when you weren&#x2019;t one, Midge says.<br><br>For writing words, our grandfather says.<br><br>What words? I say.<br><br>NO VOTES NO GOLF, our grandfather says. They put us in jail because we wrote it into the golf green with acid, me and my friend. What&#x2019;s a young girl like you wanting acid for? the chemist asked me when I went to get it. <br><br>Grandad, stop it, Midge says. <br><br>What&#x2019;s a girl like you wanting with fifteen bottles of it? he said. I told him the truth, more fool me. I want to write words on the golf course with it, I told him and he sold me it, right enough, but then he went and told Harry Cathcart at the police station exactly who&#x2019;d been round buying a job lot of acid. We were proud to go to jail, though. I was proud when they came to get me. I said to them all at the police station, I&#x2019;m doing this because my mother can&#x2019;t write her name with words, never mind vote. Your great-grandmother wrote her name with Xs. X X X. Mary Isobel Gunn. And when we went on the Mud March, our grandfather says. Boy oh boy. It was called the Mud March because &#x2014; because why?<br><br>Because of some mud, I say.<br><br>Because of the mud we got all up the hems of our skirts, our grandfather says. <br><br>Grandad, Midge says. Don&#x2019;t. <br><br>You should&#x2019;ve heard the mix of accents coming out of us all, it was like a huge flock of all the different birds, all in the sky, all singing at once. Blackbirds and chaffinches and seagulls and thrushes and starlings and swifts and peewits, imagine. From all over the country we came, from Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Huddersfield, Leeds, all the girls that worked in clothing, because that&#x2019;s what most of us did, textiles I mean, and from Glasgow, from Fife, even from right up here we went. Soon they were so afraid of us marching that they made brand new laws against us. They said we could only march in groups of no more than twelve of us. And each group of twelve girls had to be fifty yards away from any other group of twelve. And what do you think they threw at us for marching, what do you think they threw at us when we spoke in front of the great hordes of listening people? <br><br>Eggs and oranges, I say. Mud. <br><br>Tomatoes and fishheads, Midge says.<br><br>And what did we throw at the Treasury, at the Home Office, at the Houses of Parliament? he says.<br><br>Fishheads, I say. <br><br>I am finding the idea of throwing fishheads at official historic buildings very funny. Our grandfather tightens his hold round me.<br><br>No, he says. Stones, to break the windows.<br><br>Not very ladylike, Midge says from the other side of his head.<br><br>Actually, Miss Midge &#x2014;, our grandfather says. <br><br>My name&#x2019;s not Midge, Midge says.<br><br>Actually, as it happens, we were very ladylike indeed. We threw the stones in little linen bags that we&#x2019;d made ourselves with our own hands especially to put the stones in. That&#x2019;s how ladylike we were. But never mind that. Never mind that. Listen to this. Are you listening? Are you ready?<br><br>Here we go, our grandmother says. <br><br>Did I never tell you about the time when I was a really important, couldn&#x2019;t-be-done-without part of the smuggling-out-of-the-country of Burning Lily herself, the famous Building-Burning-Girl of the North East?<br><br>No, I say.<br><br>No, Midge says.<br><br>Well, I will then. Will I? our grandfather says.<br><br>Yes, I say.<br><br>Okay, Midge says.<br><br>Are you sure? he says.<br><br>Yes! we say together.<br><br>Burning Lily, he says, was famous. She was famous for lots of things. She was a dancer, and she was very very beautiful. <br><br>Always the eye for the lasses, our grandmother says with her own eyes on the television.<br><br>And one day, our grandfather says, on her twenty-first birthday, the day that the beautiful (though not near as beautiful as your grandmother, obviously) the day that the beautiful Burning Lily became a fully fledged grown-up &#x2014; which is what&#x2019;s supposed to happen on the day you&#x2019;re twenty-one &#x2014; she looked in the mirror and said to herself, I&#x2019;ve had enough of this. I&#x2019;m going to change things. So she went straight out and broke a window as a birthday present to herself.<br><br>Ridiculous present, Midge says. I&#x2019;m asking for a Mini Cooper for mine.<br><br>But soon she decided that breaking windows, though it was a good start, wasn&#x2019;t quite enough. So she started setting fire to buildings &#x2014; buildings that didn&#x2019;t have any people in them. That worked. That got their attention. She was always being carted off to jail then. And in there, in jail, in her cell, you know what she did? <br><br>What? Midge says.<br><br>She just stopped eating, he says. <br><br>Why? I say and as I say it I taste the toast taste again all through the inside of me.<br><br>Because she was like anorexic, Midge says, and had seen too many pictures of herself in magazines.<br><br>Because there wasn&#x2019;t anything else for her to do, our grandfather says to me over the top of Midge&#x2019;s head. They all did it, to protest, then. We&#x2019;d all have done it. I&#x2019;d have done it too. So would you. <br><br>Well <i>I</i> wouldn&#x2019;t, Midge says.<br><br>Yes you would. You&#x2019;d do it too, if it was the only thing you could do. So then they made Burning Lily eat.<br><br>How? I said. You can&#x2019;t<i> mak</i>e someone eat.<br><br>By putting a tube down her throat and by putting food down the tube. Except, they put it down the wrong part of her throat, into her windpipe, by mistake, and they pumped food right into her lungs.<br><br>Why? I say.<br><br>Uch, Midge says. <br><br>Rob, our grandmother says. <br><br>They have to know, our grandfather says. It&#x2019;s true. It happened. And that thing with putting the tube into her windpipe had made her very very ill, so they had to let her out of the jail because she nearly died. And that would have been very bad publicity for the police and the jail and the government. But by the time Burning Lily got better they&#x2019;d passed a new law which said: As soon as one of those girls has made herself better out there, and isn&#x2019;t going to die here in jail, on our hands, as if it was us who killed her, we can go straight back out and arrest her again. <br><br>But you know what? <br><br>What? I say.<br><br>What? Midge says.<br><br>Burning Lily kept on slipping through their fingers. She kept on getting away with it. She kept on setting fire to the empty buildings. <br><br>She was like a lunatic, Midge says.<br><br>Only empty buildings, mind, our grandfather says. <i>I will never endanger any human life except my own, she said. I always call out when I go into the building to make sure no one is in it. But I will carry on doing it for as long as it takes to change things for the better.</i> That&#x2019;s what she said in court. She used lots of different names in court. Lilian. Ida. May. It was before they knew what everyone looked like, like they do today, so she could slip through their fingers like water does if you clench your fist round it. It was before they used film and photos like they do now, to know who everyone is.<br><br>I hold up my hand, in a fist. I open it, then close it.<br><br>And she kept on doing it, he says. And the police were always after her. And next time, we knew, she&#x2019;d surely die, she would die if they got her again, because she was too weak to do that starving thing many more times. And one day, now, are you listening?<br><br>Yes, we say.<br><br>One day, our grandfather says, one of our friends came round to my house and told me: Tomorrow you&#x2019;ve got to dress up as a message boy.<br><br>What&#x2019;s a message boy? I say.<br><br>Shh, Midge says. <br><br>I was small, our grandfather says, I was nineteen, but I could pass for twelve or thirteen. And I looked a bit like a boy. <br><br>Yeah, Midge says, cause you <i>were</i> one.<br><br>Shh, I say.<br><br>And I checked through the clothes she&#x2019;d brought me in the bag, our grandfather says, they were pretty clean, they didn&#x2019;t smell too bad, they smelt a bit leathery, a bit of the smell of boys. <br><br>Uch, Midge says.<br><br>What&#x2019;s the smell of boys? I say.<br><br>And it looked likely that they&#x2019;d fit me. And lo and behold, they did. So I put them on the next morning, and I got into the grocer&#x2019;s van that stopped for me outside the door. And the girl driving the truck got out, and a boy took over the wheel, and she gave the boy a kiss as she got out. And before she got into the back of the van in under the canvas the girl gave me a rolled-up comic and an apple, and a basket of things, tea, sugar, a cabbage, some carrots. And she said, pull your cap down low and put your head inside the comic now, and start eating at that apple when you get out of the van. So I did those things, I did what she said, I opened the comic at random and held it up in front of me, and the pictures juggled up and down in front of my eyes all the way there, and when we got to the right house the boy driving stopped the van, and the front door of the house opened, and a woman shouted, All right! It&#x2019;s here! And I went round the back, that&#x2019;s where message boys were supposed to go, I was down behind the comic, and I took two bites out of the apple, which was a big one, apples were a lot bigger then, back in the days when I was a girl.<br><br>This time Midge doesn&#x2019;t say anything. She is completely listening, like I am.<br><br>And in the corridor of the big old house I saw myself in a mirror, except it wasn&#x2019;t a mirror, and it wasn&#x2019;t me. It was someone else dressed exactly the same, it was a fine-looking boy wearing the exact same clothes. But he was very very handsome, and that was how I knew he wasn&#x2019;t me and I wasn&#x2019;t him.<br><br>Rob, our grandmother says.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Gone &#39;til November</h2><p><p>It&#x2019;s late at night when Florida sheriff&#x2019;s deputy Sara Cross arrives at the scene of a roadside shooting along a deserted highway. Another deputy, Billy Flynn, her former partner, who also happens to be her former lover, has fatally shot a twenty-two-year-old man during what started out as a routine traffic stop, and she&#x2019;s the first to arrive on the scene. He claims that the man pulled a gun, and that when he didn&#x2019;t respond to Billy&#x2019;s commands to drop it, Billy shot him. Billy is clearly upset, shaken up; Sarah sees the gun in the dead man&#x2019;s hand and the bag of illegal weapons in the trunk of his car and believes Billy&#x2019;s actions were justified.<br><br>Up north in New Jersey, Mikey-Mike runs a major drug operation and is tightening his hold on the competition, making a deal with a new supplier.

This is his third novel, following the acclaimed <i>The Heartbreak Lounge</i> and the Barry Award--finalist <i>The Barbed-Wire Kiss</i>. He lives in New Jersey.</p><p>ONE</p><p>Sara steered the cruiser onto the shoulder, saw what was ahead, thought, Bad news.</p><p>Gravel crunched under the tires as the Crown Vic settled at an angle. The radio crackled.</p><p>"Eight-seventeen, are you on scene?" Angie, the night dispatcher. "Have you responded?"</p><p>Sara lifted the dash mike, keyed it. "Eight-seventeen here. On scene now. Will advise."</p><p>In the blaze of her headlights, Billy stood behind his own green-and-white cruiser, looking off into the swamp, hands on his hips. Farther up on the shoulder was a gray late-model Honda Accord, trunk open. Blue, red, and yellow lights bathed the night.</p><p>She replaced the mike, tried to memorize the scene, wishing the grants had come through for the dashboard video cameras. She looked at her watch. Two ten.</p><p>Billy turned toward her, face blank. She could see his jaws moving. He was chewing gum. After a moment, he looked back at the swamp.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t seen him at the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, but she&#x2019;d known he was on duty tonight, had heard him on the scanner. Part of her had hoped they&#x2019;d cross paths before shift&#x2019;s end, part of her didn&#x2019;t. When she&#x2019;d gotten the call, shots fired, she&#x2019;d feared the worst. Now here he was, staring out into the swamp, looking lost.</p><p>What have you done, Billy Boy? And why did you have to do it on my shift?</p><p>She opened the door, took her portable radio from the passenger seat, and stepped out onto gravel. She fit the radio into its holder on her duty belt and plugged in the body mike clipped to her left shoulder. Her thumb slipped the holster loop that held the Glock in place on her right hip.</p><p>The air was thick, the heat oppressive after the air-conditioned cruiser. Hot for mid-October. No moon, but a sky full of stars.</p><p>The Honda had New Jersey plates. Billy had parked behind it, angled to the left, in the standard motor vehicle stop position, so the cruiser would protect him from oncoming traffic when he got out.</p><p>He half-turned. "Hey, Sara."</p><p>"Hey, Billy. You all right?"</p><p>He looked away from her, back at the swamp.</p><p>She had her hair tied up in back, could feel sweat form at the nape of her neck, drip beneath the Kevlar vest under her uniform shirt. She came up to stand beside him, followed his gaze. They were looking down a slight incline to the edge of the swamp. There was a patch of sodden grass, then a deeper dark where the trees started, Spanish moss hanging from them like cotton. In the grass, just short of the trees, a man lay facedown, right leg twisted under left, right arm extended.</p><p>"There he is," Billy said.</p><p>She looked around. She&#x2019;d seen no traffic since she&#x2019;d gotten the call, taken the turnoff for CR-23. Only locals used this route, few at night. To the east, acres and acres of sugarcane, then the distant glow of town. To the west, the gray ghosts of cypress trees, endless miles of wetlands stretching to Punta Gorda and the coast. She could smell the swamp, the rotten egg scent of sulfur.</p><p>The cruiser radios crackled in unison, the sound muffled by the closed doors. Off in the dark, as if in answer, bullfrogs sounded. Then another, deeper noise, the low bellowing of a gator. The light from their rollers painted the trees, the swamp, illuminated the body below.</p><p>"Is he dead?" she said.</p><p>He nodded. "Or close to it. He hasn&#x2019;t moved at all. EMTs on their way."</p><p>"I heard."</p><p>She took the heavy aluminum flashlight from the ring on her belt and pushed the button. The bright halogen beam leaped out into darkness. She swept it across the man&#x2019;s back. His head was turned to the right, and even from here she could see his eyes were open.</p><p>Chinos, blue dress shirt, a deep, dark stain between the shoulder blades, shirt soaked with blood. A black man, young, dressed too well to be from around here.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m going to have a look," she said.</p><p>"Careful. You step into a chuckhole down there, you&#x2019;ll break your ankle."</p><p>She shifted the light to her left hand, took a step down the incline, her right hand resting on the Glock. She could hear sirens in the distance.</p><p>She picked her way down the slope. When she reached the grass, she felt it give spongily under her shoes, water coming up around them.</p><p>She shone the light along the wet ground, looking for snakes. Something moved and splashed in the darkness. The noise of the bullfrogs stopped for a moment, then started again.</p><p>The gun was about a foot from the man&#x2019;s right hand. She held the light on it. A blued revolver, .38 maybe, rubber grips. She made a grid with the flashlight beam, looking for another weapon, footprints. Nothing.</p><p>"Anyone else in the car?" she called up. The sirens closer now.</p><p>"No. Just him. I told him to stop. I told him."</p><p>She crouched, not letting her knees touch the ground. Up close, she could see the gold wire-rim glasses twisted beneath his face, one side still looped over his ear. He looked like a teenager, hair close-cropped, a small gold ring in his right earlobe. His eyes were wide.</p><p>She played the beam down the body. Left arm folded beneath, right outstretched as if pointing to the gun. The shoes were tan leather, polished, the upturned soles shiny and new. No way he could have run on this grass, gotten away.</p><p>She touched the side of his neck. A faint warmth, but no pulse.</p><p>From above her, Billy said, "He dead?"</p><p>"Yes. He&#x2019;s dead."</p><p>Something moved in the trees, and her hand fell to the Glock. A shadow separated itself from the blackness, took wing silently. She looked up, watched it fly away, etched for an instant against the stars, wondered what it was.</p><p>She went back up the incline, careful where she put her feet. When she reached the gravel, Billy was standing beside the Honda&#x2019;s open trunk.</p><p>"Check out this shit," he said.</p><p>She went over and shone the light inside. The trunk was empty except for a nylon gearbag, partially unzipped. She saw the glint of metal within.</p><p>"You look in there?" she said.</p><p>"Yeah. He was acting nervous, so I asked him to open the trunk. When I saw the bag inside, he took off. I told him to stop. When he got down there, he rounded on me, drew down."</p><p>His voice was unsteady. She looked at him, saw his eyes were wet.</p><p>Sirens rose and fell in the distance.</p><p>"Cold out here," he said. "When did it get so cold?"</p><p>He paused between words, chest rising and falling rapidly, as if he were hyperventilating. The onset of shock.</p><p>"You should sit in the car," she said. She tucked the flashlight under her arm, took the thin Kevlar gloves from her belt and pulled them on, punching the Vs of her fingers together to get the fit tight.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m all right," he said.</p><p>"You don&#x2019;t look it."</p><p>She shone the flashlight into the bag, reached down and pulled the zippered edges apart. Inside was a boxy MAC-10 machine gun with a pistol grip and a dull black finish. Under it were two semiautomatic handguns: a chrome Smith and Wesson with rubber grips, a blue-steel Heckler and Koch, both 9 mm. Boxes of ammunition, extra magazines for the MAC-10. No wonder he ran.</p><p>She heard a noise, turned to see Billy bent over on the shoulder, hands on his knees. He spit his gum out, gagged, vomited thin and watery onto the gravel.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m okay," he said. He raised a hand to ward her off. "I&#x2019;m okay."</p><p>He spit, straightened, turned away from her, bent and waited, ready to vomit again. She could hear his rapid breathing. He&#x2019;s going to pass out.</p><p>He put his hands on his hips, sucking in air, getting his control back. She watched him for a moment, then walked around the Honda and shone the light through the windows. There was a folded Florida map on the front passenger floor. In back was a child safety seat and a brown leather overnight bag.</p><p>"He has a kid," Billy said. "You see that seat? He has a kid."</p><p>Maybe not.</p><p>She looked down the road. Coming over a small crest, she could see emergency lights&#x2014;two cruisers and an EMT van.</p><p>She looked at him.</p><p>"Anything you want to tell me before the sheriff gets here?" she said.</p><p>He looked at the approaching cruisers, then back at her, shook his head.</p><p>"No," he said. "I&#x2019;m sorry, Sara. I never had a choice."</p><p>"You did what you had to do. It&#x2019;ll be all right."</p><p>Sirens all around them, the cruisers pulling up abreast of her own, the EMT truck pulling ahead. She moved closer to Billy, stood beside him.</p><p>The sirens rose, fell, and died. Car doors opened and closed around them. They stood together in the nexus of rolling lights.</p><p>She looked up, saw the far-off silhouette of a bird against the starfield. An instant later, it was gone. She wondered if it was ever there at all.</p><p>"Well," Sheriff Hammond said. "What&#x2019;s your take on this mess?"</p><p>They were in his office, the door shut. Floor-to-ceiling windows looked out on the rest of the station. Through the window behind his desk, she could see the small stretch of lawn lined with whitewashed stone, a bare flagpole lit by flood-lamps.</p><p>Four A.M. and he was in jeans and flannel shirt, unshaven. His hair was longish, his nose laced with broken blood vessels. He was from Mississippi, had come east thirty years ago but never lost that soft accent.</p><p>Sara had a bottle of water from the break-room vending machine but hadn&#x2019;t touched it yet. She wished she had an aspirin. It was her first midnight shift in months, and she&#x2019;d been tired all night. Now she could feel the familiar beginnings of a migraine, the pulsing of a vein in her temple.</p><p>"From what I saw," she said, "it looks like it played out the way he told it. I responded as soon as I got the call. There wasn&#x2019;t a whole lot of time between the stop and when I got there."</p><p>He took an unsharpened pencil off the desk and leaned back in his chair. His desktop was cluttered, a bundle of papers held down by a dummy hand grenade he&#x2019;d brought home from Vietnam, wire IN and OUT baskets, a framed photo of his daughter as a teenager.</p><p>On a credenza behind him was a computer, shut down for the night. Beside it, in a plastic liner, was his sheriff&#x2019;s campaign hat, which he wore only on formal occasions. When he&#x2019;d taken over the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, he&#x2019;d discontinued the use of their Smokey the Bear hats, opted for black baseball caps instead, and then made those optional as well, a change Sara had always been grateful for.</p><p>He scratched his jaw, tapped the pencil on the edge of the desk. She could sense his awkwardness.</p><p>"The lawyer from the Fraternal Order of Police is on his way," he said. "Boone from the state attorney&#x2019;s office in La Belle is still at the scene, but he&#x2019;ll roll back here soon. He&#x2019;ll be talking with you as well. That might be a little uncomfortable."</p><p>"Why&#x2019;s that?"</p><p>"He&#x2019;ll have to know about you two."</p><p>Doesn&#x2019;t everybody already?</p><p>She cracked the cap on the bottle, drank, replaced it.</p><p>"I understand that, Sheriff. But just for the record, that was over two years ago."</p><p>"I know. I&#x2019;m just saying. Small county like this, small town, small department. If we don&#x2019;t tell him, someone else will.

If he feels he needs to bring them in, he will."</p><p>"Whatever the situation, this Willis wasn&#x2019;t a tourist, out there in the middle of the night, weapons in the trunk."</p><p>"I expect not."</p><p>"And what was he doing on that road in the first place? There&#x2019;s nothing out there for miles. If you&#x2019;re just passing through, heading south, interstate&#x2019;s easier, safer."</p><p>"Hopefully, all questions which will be answered."</p><p>She drank more water, put the bottle down, rubbed her left temple.</p><p>"Who&#x2019;s watching the little guy?" he said.</p><p>"JoBeth. She&#x2019;s at my house."</p><p>"JoBeth Ryan?"</p><p>"She&#x2019;s driving now, so it&#x2019;s easier for her."</p><p>"JoBeth&#x2019;s a good kid. And her father&#x2019;s a good man.

"It&#x2019;s none of my business."</p><p>"It&#x2019;s okay. There&#x2019;s just not much to say. We&#x2019;re getting on with our lives, you know?

Not bad for a gal who never actually existed. <br> "Born" in 1921 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to proud corporate parents, Betty Crocker has grown, over eight decades, into one of the most successful branding campaigns the world has ever known. Now, at long last, she has her own biography. <i>Finding Betty Crocker</i> draws on six years of research plus an unprecedented look into the General Mills archives to reveal how a fictitious spokesperson was enthusiastically welcomed into kitchens and shopping carts across the nation. <br> The Washburn Crosby Company (one of the forerunners to General Mills) chose the cheery all-American "Betty" as a first name and paired it with Crocker, after William Crocker, a well-loved company director. Betty was to be the newest member of the Home Service Department, where she would be a "friend" to consumers in search of advice on baking -- and, in an unexpected twist, their personal lives. <br> Soon Betty Crocker had her own national radio show, which, during the Great Depression and World War II, broadcast money-saving recipes, rationing tips, and messages of hope. Over 700,000 women joined Betty's wartime Home Legion program, while more than one million women -- and men -- registered for the <i>Betty Crocker Cooking School of the Air</i> during its twenty-seven-year run. <br> At the height of Betty Crocker's popularity in the 1940s, she received as many as four to five thousand letters daily, care of General Mills. When her first full-scale cookbook, <i>Betty Crocker's Picture Cook Book,</i> or "Big Red," as it is affectionately known, was released in 1950, first-year sales rivaled those of the Bible. Today, over two hundred products bear her name, along with thousands of recipe booklets and cookbooks, an interactive website, and a newspaper column. <br> What is it about Betty? In answering the question of why everyone was buying what she was selling, author Susan Marks offers an entertaining, charming, and utterly unique look -- through words and images -- at an American icon situated between profound symbolism and classic kitchen kitsch.</p><p><b>Susan Marks's</b> interest in Betty Crocker began during her stint as a tour guide for the Minnesota Historical Society, then evolved into a master's thesis, doc-u-mentary film project, and, ultimately, this book. Currently, she writes and produces videos for corporations as well as for nonprofits and the arts.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>The day before the Fourth of July, I stopped by my parents' house and was not surprised to find my mother busy in the kitchen, baking a red-, white-, and blue-layered cake from Betty Crocker mixes.<br><br>"Do you remember when I thought you were Betty Crocker?" I asked.<br><br>My mother smiled. "I sure do."<br><br>"You were about seven," she recalled, "and it was your turn to bring the treat bucket to your Brownie troop meeting. Instead of buying something, I thought it would be fun to bake cookies together. So I found a chocolate chip cookie recipe from my files called 'Betty Crocker's Bisquickies.'"<br><br>"You seemed delighted, so I suggested we bake another batch sometime," my mother explained. "Then you stood right here at the kitchen counter and started flipping through my Betty Crocker cookbook and became convinced that Betty's picture was actually me."<br><br>While my mother and I baked the Bisquickies, she shared her childhood memories of an ongoing debate about Betty Crocker. Was she a real person? Household opinion was deeply divided. In the spring of 1950, my grandma wrote to Betty Crocker for some advice on meal planning and received a reply in return. But, she wondered, was the letter signed "Cordially yours" truly from "Betty" herself?<br><br>Absolutely, thought my mother, because Betty had her own radio show and cake mixes. Years later, a women's magazine called Betty "an ageless thirty-two." As a kid, my mother's powers of reason were wholeheartedly straightforward. In her mind, "ageless" was proof that Betty Crocker had an age, just as any real woman did. But my grandmother still wasn't so sure.<br><br>Fast-forward to 1998: my grandmother was visiting from out of town. She was thrilled to hear that I was writing a book on Betty Crocker and promised to bring Betty Crocker recipe booklets on her next visit. As we sat and talked, memories came flooding back. For years, she saved Betty Crocker coupon "points" to help my mom fill her hope chest with Betty's Oneida "My Rose" silver pattern. I was surprised to hear my grandmother speak of how controversial cake mixes such as Betty's were when they first came on the market.<br><br>With her next visit came an unexpected surprise. Standing in my parents' kitchen, my grandmother handed me something she had cherished since 1950. It was that letter from Betty Crocker. For the first time in my life, I was speechless.<br><br>I never imagined that this little piece of history would survive all these years. So much of culinary history is steeped in an oral tradition -- mothers teaching daughters, who in turn share their stories of kitchen wisdom with daughters of their own. But Betty Crocker had a hand in changing all that. Before cookbooks and recipe files were commonplace, Betty encouraged my grandma, and millions of Americans like her, to write in search of answers, guidance, or friendly advice.<br><br>Into this great divide stepped Betty Crocker with her kitchen inspirational, "You can do it, and I can help you." Empowered by her words, countless women -- and men -- made a collective connection, not to Betty Crocker the corporate symbol, but to Betty Crocker the person. But who was she, really? <i>Finding Betty Crocker</i> chronicles an American search for her identity that stretches over fifty states and across the turn of a century.<br><br>"Born" in 1921 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to proud corporate parents, Betty Crocker has grown, over eight decades, into one of the most successful branding campaigns the world has ever known. In 1945, <i>Fortune</i> magazine named her the second most popular American woman, right behind Eleanor Roosevelt, and dubbed Betty America's First Lady of Food. And in 2000, an Adweek poll revealed that a majority "voted" for Betty Crocker in a mock presidential contest, beating out a ballot of five other (Mr. Clean, Mr. Goodwrench, Aunt Jemima, Ronald McDonald, and Cap'n Crunch) brand icons.<br><br>What is it about Betty that has motivated so many Americans to award her a place in their hearts and minds? The sheer magnitude -- and longevity -- of her popularity speaks volumes of the need she has fulfilled in countless lives. Millions have traveled to Minneapolis to tour the Betty Crocker Kitchens, hoping to catch a glimpse of this beloved national icon. And more than a few devoted fans left in tears when they discovered it was impossible to meet her.<br><br>But to all the people she's helped, instructed, and even inspired, Betty Crocker has heart. And so she lives on. As for her enduring appeal, perhaps this Depression-era radio listener expressed it best, "Your talks, Betty Crocker, have given me hope."<br><br>Copyright � 2005 by Susan Marks</p><h2>Humility of Heart</h2><p>Humility of Heart - by Rev.

The Allies harried the retreating Germans, who left their tanks and heavy weapons south of the Seine, and by mid-September the Allies were coming up against the defenses of Germany itself, the impressive Westwall.<br><br>As far as the Allies were concerned, the Germans were beaten. The scent of immediate victory was in the air, the only question was where to apply the coup de grace. Logistics demanded that this should be a single thrust rather than Eisenhower&#x2019;s broad front approach. Montgomery&#x2014;the architect of victory in Normandy&#x2014;proposed a daring plan to circumvent the Westwall, thrust towards Berlin, and make use of the newly created 1st Allied Airborne Army. The plan was simple: use the Paratroopers to hold key bridges along a single route along which British XXX Corps would make an advance that would be &#x201c;rapid and violent, and without regard to what is happening on the flanks.&#x201d; US 101st Airborne would land north of Eindhoven; 82nd Airborne at Nijmegen; British 1st Airborne at Arnhem&#x2014;the so-called &#x201c;bridge too far.&#x201d;<br><br>Unfortunately, the plan was flawed, the execution imperfect, and the Germans far from beaten. In spite of the audacious actions of the Paratroopers who would cover themselves with glory, Operation Market Garden showed that the German ground forces would still provide the Allies with stiff opposition in the West.<br><br>And then, in 1977, A Bridge Too Far came out. With levels of realism that wouldn&#x2019;t be approached for twenty years, the movie produced a view of the battle that subverted reality and permeated public perception. Just as George C. Scott produced the definitive Patton, so A Bridge Too Far provided an unnuanced view of the battles that historians have battled to correct ever since.<br><br>As with its companion volumes on D-Day, the Bocage, and the Ardennes battlefields, this book provides a balanced, up-to-date view of the operation making full use of modern research. With over 500 illustrations including many maps, aerial and then-and-now photography, it will provide the reader with an easy-to-read, up-to-date examination of each part of the operation, benefitting from on-the-ground research by Tom Timmermans, who lives in Eindhoven.</p><p>Simon Forty was educated in Dorset and the north of England before reading history at London University&#x2019;s School of Slavonic and East European Studies.

By the time you've finished reading his book you may not be convinced that Sicilians are responsible for chicken soup, rice, and pasta (as the Old Man claims) but you may well believe they invented laughter. </p><p> The writing style is relaxed and conversational. The recipes -- more than 160 -- combine Sicilian and American influences and include antipasto and salads; vegetables; soups and stews; pasta and sauces; seafood; poultry and meat; and sweets. </p><p> The dishes are all simple, authentic, and delicious: </p><ul> <li></li>A Meatloaf Like No Other (combines Italian sausage, pine nuts, olives and wine)- Shellfish Marinara 1, 2, and 3 (each a distinct version) <li></li>Pasta with Polpette (Sicilian meatballs that have a flattened oval shape, much like a stepped-on football. Odd they may look, but they're never tough since you need brown only two sides) <li></li>Pasta with Beans, Pasta with Artichokes, Pasta with Cauliflower, Pasta with Eggplant <li></li>An abundance of recipes for chicken and for fish -- and one for chicken with fish (plus a handful of dried figs) <li></li>Traditional veal dishes <li></li>Desserts that include holiday pastries, a ricotta pie, and a Sicilian rice pudding </ul><p></p><p> Readers not familiar with Sicilian cooking are in for a treat. The food of the Mediterranean's largest island was influenced by the people who conquered it. From the Arabs and Moors come stuffed vegetables and the use of dried fruits and pine nuts. From the Greeks come olive oil and lemon. It is a simpler cuisine than that of the north, emphasizing leaner ingredients. For Sicilians, seafood is more important than meat, and lamb is more likely to be seen on the table than is pork. </p><p> <b>The Sicilian Gentleman's Cookbook</b> is filled with all the warmth, love, and happiness of the home that the Old Man created. The recipes are generously garnished with anecdotes and old-world philosophy. </p></p><p><p> Author <b>Don Baratta</b> captures the voice of The Old Man. Don, who makes his home in Washington State, was born and grew up in the Bronx, in the midst of Sicilian neighborhood. As for the Old Man, nobody is sure where he was born -- maybe Sicily, or possibly somewhere in New England. </p><p> From the chapter on <i>Vegetables and Stuffings - Verdure e Ripieni</i>, sample recipes and an excerpt </p><p><b><i> Fried Cauliflower</i> </b></p><b> Cavolfiore Fritto</b> <p> You will need: </p> 1 head cauliflower 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 tbsp corn starch 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 2 eggs, well beaten 1 1/2 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp salt vegetable oil (approximately 4 cups) <p> <i>Preparation:</i> </p><p> Lower cauliflower into a pot of salted, boiling water. Return water to a boil, then remove and drain the cauliflower. Separate into florets and set them aside. </p><p> Combine all other ingredients except the vegetable oil into a large bowl and beat vigorously until mixture is without lumps. </p><p> Heat vegetable oil to 375� in a deep pan or fryer. Dip each floret into the batter, then drop it into the oil. Do not overcrowd. </p><p> Fry for 4-5 minutes until golden brown, turning pieces so they cook evenly. Serve hot. </p><p> <i>Serves 5-6.</i> </p><p> &nbsp; </p><p> Cauliflower is a much-hated vegetable in this country, yet it need not be so. It is usually boiled and accompanied by small groans. A non-Italian guest once watched with interest the respect the Old Man paid this detested food. Her curiosity broke down her ancient reservations, and she tried a piece. The result was near-disbelief in the lively flavor. The Old Man flatly pointed out (indifferent to the insult he offered the poor girl's family), "If it had been prepared correctly, you would have always liked it!" So much for polite chatter. He remained unrepentant all his life. </p><p> You know, I have a theory about vegetables. I also have a theory about tools. I advise you to buy either the best or the cheapest. Trying to compromise with something that claims to be a little bit good and a little bit cheap will bring you to calamity. But the best you will take good care of; and the cheapest can be used once and then thrown away. </p><p> But this is not my theory about vegetables. With vegetables, I suggest you grow your own. I do not mean you should cultivate a farm for this would leave you little time to enjoy anything else. But you can grow that which you always use, such as plum tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, and perhaps some eggplant. And don't forget about sweet basil. </p><p> The rest must be bought in a store, and you must make the best of this situation. You will have noticed how Italians spend a good deal of time searching among the produce, always seeking perfection. Some have been known to stand at attention and salute a particularly fine specimen. I know of a musically inclined young man who would sing an aria from Turandot at the sight of a ripe melon, but this demonstration of exuberance I feel to be misplaced. Artichokes, perhaps ... even an eggplant. But a melon? </p><p> My point, by the way, is that Italians have the extraordinary idea that fresh produce used immediately is half the battle. To date, no one has yet proven them wrong. </p><p> &nbsp; </p> <p><b><i> Fried Squash Blossoms</i> </b></p> <b>Fritto di Fiori du Zucca</b> <p> If you grow squash of any kind, you are lucky in that you will be provided with the big, puffy, orange flowers that precede the fruit. They are quite wonderful when stuffed and fried. You will, of course, have to leave enough of them on the vine to guarantee getting the squash as well -- but that's no great problem. </p><p> You will need: </p> 12 unopened squash blossoms 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, diced 1/2 cup grated Romano cheese 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped salt and pepper to taste all-purpose flour (for dredging) 2 eggs, well beaten 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil <p></p><p> <i>Preparation:</i> </p><p> Gently wash each flower under running water. Pat dry and set aside. Mix cheeses and parsley together and flavor with salt and pepper. </p><p> Slit each flower along the side and push cheese filling into the flower. Dredge each flower in flour and then in beaten eggs. </p><p> Heat olive oil in a large skillet and gently lower filled flowers into hot oil. Brown both sides quickly. </p><p> Serve hot. A wonderful thing! </p><p> <i>Serves 4-6</i> </p></p><h2>Son of No One (Dark-Hunter Novels)</h2><p><p>In the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>Son of No One</i>, part of the blockbuster <i>The Dark-Hunters </i>series by Sherrilyn Kenyon, it's not easy being life's own personal joke, but Josette Landry has made an unstable peace with the beast.

And you&#x2019;re currently stomping all over it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Standing in the hallway, next to a stack of boxes, Selena Laurens laughed at her cousin&#x2019;s surly tone. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right, Jo-Jo. Just remember with our Cajun-Romani blood, even if I&#x2019;m dead to you, in either realm, you&#x2019;ll still be able to hear me. I will haunt you forever.&#x201d;</p> <p>Josette Landry cringed at a childhood nickname that had always made her feel like a yappy Pomeranian. Normally, she&#x2019;d correct Selena&#x2019;s usage, but at this point, she was too tired and soul-sick to bother. &#x201c;Look, the only thing I want to summon right now is a trip to Baskin-Robbins. So unless you&#x2019;ve got a quart of creamy goodness in your purse, stop talking and start driving.&#x201d; Jo gently tugged Selena toward the door and ignored the bells that jingled from the hem of Selena&#x2019;s silver and purple broomstick skirt. A self-proclaimed fortune-teller, her cousin bought into the weirdness of their gypsy heritage lock, stock, and both flaming barrels.</p> <p>Jo paused as she swept a glance from the top of Selena&#x2019;s long, curly brown hair, white peasant blouse, and loud, statement moon necklace to her Birkenstock sandals.</p> <p>Take that back. Selena didn&#x2019;t buy into it, she rolled around in the bad stereotype like a happy piglet in a mud factory.</p> <p>Selena snorted. &#x201c;Drowning your problems in Rock &#x2019;n Pop Swirl sherbet isn&#x2019;t going to solve anything.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Forget sherbet.

Of course I&#x2019;m not all right. I&#x2019;ll <i>never</i> be all right.&#x201d;</p> <p>Shaking her head, Selena waited while Jo locked her apartment door, though why she bothered, she had no idea. The only thing of value was her three dogs. And if the burglars were toting Beggin&#x2019; Strips, they&#x2019;d happily abandon her without a fight. Evil drooling canine snots.</p> <p>Jo caught a glimpse of the boxes she&#x2019;d been packing through the window and winced. If her lifelong run of bad luck didn&#x2019;t change soon, she would be out on the street and she&#x2019;d be forced to turn her beloved dogs over to a shelter.</p> <p>Or worse, her older sister.</p> <p>How could it have come to this? This was not supposed to be her life. She&#x2019;d never been irresponsible. While other kids went out drinking and partying, she&#x2019;d stayed home and studied hard. Graduated at the top of her class. She&#x2019;d scrimped and saved, and had lost her entire nest egg on lawyer fees when she&#x2019;d divorced her husband for refusing to work. The reason being that if Barry Riggio was working, he wouldn&#x2019;t have time to screw other women in their bed, while Jo slaved away at two jobs to support them!</p> <p>Yeah. She&#x2019;d never felt more betrayed or hurt. <i>I won&#x2019;t ever trust another man again.</i></p> <p>And if that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, corporate downsizing had cost her her day job, and she&#x2019;d lost her night job six weeks ago after the factory had burned down from a freak electrical fire.</p> <p>Overwhelmed by the failure of her life and ambitions, Jo turned toward the street and headed for the curb where Selena&#x2019;s Jeep was parked. If only Selena&#x2019;s husband and his law firm handled divorces, it might have saved her something. But Bill&#x2019;s specialty was corporate and criminal law, not family law. And while his attorney friend had given her a discounted rate, it&#x2019;d still taken every dime of her savings to offload the cheating freeloader.</p> <p>&#x201c;What am I going to do, Lainie?&#x201d;</p> <p>Selena opened the car door for her. &#x201c;Breathe, honey. This too shall pass. In the meantime I can&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I will <i>not</i> take a loan from you. Ever!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Will you take a job?&#x201d;</p> <p>Jo waited until Selena got into the Jeep on the other side before she responded. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t read tea leaves or palms. And if you put me in your store, be warned, I&#x2019;m not sure I can leash my sarcasm.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, I know you and retail are a bad combination. Your uncle Jacob is still railing at family get-togethers about the one <i>day</i> you spent working in his garage.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so melodramatic&nbsp;&#x2026; I only worked there for two hours before Aunt Paulina gave me the heave-ho.&#x201d;</p> <p>Selena burst out laughing. &#x201c;My point exactly. Anyway, as I value my customer base and respect them highly, I have no intention of putting <i>you</i> behind a counter where you&#x2019;ll single-handedly drive my business into the gutter. What I have for you, Ms. Snark &#x2019;Ems, is to do what you do best. Work as a camerawoman.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jo perked up immediately. &#x201c;Oh? Really?&#x201d;</p> <p>Selena nodded as she navigated through traffic. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one small catch.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ah, gah, I knew it! It&#x2019;s for a porn site, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Selena screwed her face up, then appeared to consider it. &#x201c;Although, knowing you, you&#x2019;d probably prefer the porn over this assignment.&#x201d;</p> <p>A sick feeling settled in Jo&#x2019;s stomach as she realized it had to be something paranormal, and dumber than dumb&#x2019;s widow&#x2019;s doorknob. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have some friends&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No! I&#x2019;ve met your friends. I&#x2019;d rather work at Tabitha&#x2019;s triple-X-rated store, sorting glittered pasties and edible thongs.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I can arrange that, too. Just remember, you have to learn the difference between K-Y and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Stop! Right there! I don&#x2019;t want to know about your sister&#x2019;s depravity. I&#x2019;m still scarred from the story she told of finding someone&#x2019;s dentures in the back thong drawer.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a prude.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Me and Amanda. The sole bastions of nonlunacy in a long line of certifiable nutsos.&#x201d;</p> <p>Selena paused at a light to glare at her. &#x201c;Do you want me to tell you about the job or not?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Jo conceded reluctantly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll listen, and at least I can jump out of the car from here and walk back.&#x201d;</p> <p>Selena snorted. &#x201c;My friends are trying to get their own cable show.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jo suddenly regretted her snottiness. &#x201c;That actually sounds promising. What kind of show?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Hell&#x2019;s Calling. The Women of Demonology and Possession.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hello, detour back to the No-way-in-hell-will-I-do-this exit ramp.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Selena turned left. &#x201c;Just out of curiosity, I know it&#x2019;s been almost five months, but have you told your parents yet about the divorce, and your foreclosure notice?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I hate you, Selena.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t. You love me with the passion of a thousand paparazzi after an Emma Stone exclusive.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jo blew her cousin a raspberry. &#x201c;You keep believing those lies.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not lies. I&#x2019;m psychic. I <i>know</i>.&#x201d;</p> <p>Amused and disgusted, Jo rolled her eyes. As much as she hated to admit it, Selena was right. She loved and adored her quacky older cousin more than anything. Lunacy and all. &#x201c;How much does this job pay? And when would they want me to start?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If they could find a reliable, unflappable cameraperson, they&#x2019;d start tomorrow. But everyone they&#x2019;ve brought onsite has fled screaming in fifteen minutes or less.&#x201d;</p> <p>Wow, that was impressive. Even for Selena&#x2019;s group of <i>special</i> weirdos. &#x201c;Are they that hard to work with?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. They&#x2019;re actually quite lovely.&#x2026; The place they&#x2019;re investigating is <i>that</i> haunted.&#x201d;</p> <p>This time, Jo gave in and burst out laughing. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not serious?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Swear it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And where are they investigating? The LaLaurie mansion?&#x201d;</p> <p>Selena shook her head. &#x201c;Karma&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;</p> <p>It figured. In their long familial line of peculiar characters and those willing to believe in flying fairies, alien possessions, and Santa Claus, Karma Devereaux was Queen Lunatica&nbsp;&#x2026; the woman had even nicknamed her own son E.T. and the kid&#x2019;s real name was Ian.</p> <p>&#x201c;Lainie, if I roll my eyes any farther back in my head, I&#x2019;ll probably swallow them.&#x201d;</p> <p>Selena reached over and playfully Gibbs-slapped her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You needed it. Besides, that cynicism will serve us well. We need someone who doesn&#x2019;t spook onsite with the camera.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, well, having survived many a sleepover and family reunion with you bunch of loons, I&#x2019;m immune to <i>most</i> anything. Aunt Xilla not included.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Good. I&#x2019;ll call everyone and tell them to be at Karma&#x2019;s by eleven tomorrow. Will that work for you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d; Jo narrowed her gaze on Selena as she pulled up to Baskin-Robbins. &#x201c;You still haven&#x2019;t told me how much I&#x2019;ll make for this misbegotten journey to the Armpit of Hades, AKA Karma&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Three hundred and fifty a day, plus meals.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jo gaped. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re joshing me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Nope. That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve had to go up to, to entice anyone to the job. But we have yet to pay anyone more than twenty bucks for their fifteen-minute appearance, and most have told us to keep our money because they&#x2019;re afraid it&#x2019;s cursed or haunted, too.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jo scoffed at the paranoia. &#x201c;What a bunch of superstitious pansies.&#x2026;&#x201d; But that might be a good thing for her. &#x201c;You think I can get four hundred a day?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;At this point? Probably.&#x201d; Selena reached for her phone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll text Mama Lisa and find out.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;All right. You get me that, and you have a fearless photographer, camerawoman, gofer, janitor&nbsp;&#x2026; whatever.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Would you be willing to spend the night there, too?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jo said emphatically.</p> <p>Selena looked up from the phone with an arched brow. &#x201c;I thought you weren&#x2019;t afraid.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not afraid of ghosts or demons. I&#x2019;m terrified of Karma. No offense, your sister&#x2019;s crazy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, she is. Honestly, she scares me, too.&#x201d; Selena&#x2019;s smile widened. &#x201c;Mama Lisa agrees to your price. She said that if you&#x2019;ll actually make it through three days of filming, there&#x2019;s a thousand-dollar bonus for you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jo was almost ecstatic. Until the reality fairy came and slapped her. Suddenly terrified, she started searching the sky above them.</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that look mean?&#x201d; Selena asked as she, too, searched the heavens.</p> <p>&#x201c;Things are going too good.&#x201d; She slid her gaze back to her cousin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting for lightning to strike me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous. It&#x2019;s a perfectly sunny day.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, and hell&#x2019;s just a hot tub. I&#x2019;m telling you, Lainie, something real bad&#x2019;s going to happen. I know it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2019;Cause from the moment of her first breath, she&#x2019;d been cursed. And nothing <i>ever</i> worked out for her.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Hey, Ma?&#x201d;</i></p> <p>Karma Devereaux sighed heavily as she heard her son&#x2019;s call from the hallway upstairs. She stepped out of her living room to look up at the landing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little busy, Boo. What do you need?&#x201d;</p> <p>As her twelve-year-old leaned over the balustrade to look down at her, his dark curls were a mess around his head as if he&#x2019;d been out in a wind. Something strange, since it&#x2019;d been a warm day with little breeze. &#x201c;You know this freaky-creepy weird vase up here that has that moon rune writing on it? The one you told me to never touch?&#x201d;</p> <p>The blood left her face. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t touch it, did you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Nope. But Rug made another break for freedom and when I cornered him in the room I&#x2019;m not supposed to be in, I saw it on the floor, broken. And I swear to all that is holy, neither me nor the hamster did it. It looks like it&#x2019;s been done.&#x201d;</p> <p>Terrified for her son, Karma ran up the stairs as fast as she could. &#x201c;Did you touch <i>any</i>thing?&#x201d;</p> <p>E.T. held up the hamster cuddled in his hands. &#x201c;Just Rug.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Put him in his cage.&#x201d; She waited for her son to leave before she entered the room cautiously. Dread consumed her, and as soon as she saw the broken vase, she knew why. That hadn&#x2019;t fallen on the floor and broken by accident.</p> <p>Something had caused it to <i>shatter</i>.</p> <p>And that explained why there&#x2019;d been so much activity in her house lately. Why everyone new ran screaming for the door.</p> <p>One of the oldest, deadliest beings in the universe had been set loose.</p> <p>Sick to her stomach, she pulled her phone from her pocket and dialed the number of last resort.</p> <p>Zeke answered on the first ring. &#x201c;Pest Control by Zeke Jacobson. What&#x2019;s eating your soul today?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re really not funny.&#x201d;</p> <p>He ignored her droll tone. &#x201c;Karma? That you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah. We got a problem, buddy, and I need the cavalry.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d you do now?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I swear I didn&#x2019;t do this. I&#x2019;m really not sure how this happened, but&nbsp;&#x2026; Valac escaped.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Please tell me that when you say that, you mean he&#x2019;s slamming at your doors and wants out to play. Not that he&#x2019;s out, out, as in out.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He gone. High-tailed. Skedaddled. I didn&#x2019;t even know he&#x2019;d broken loose. No idea when he took off.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Was he summoned?&#x201d;</p> <p>She toed at the vase. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she breathed. &#x201c;But how did they get to him past my protection?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No idea. But they had to be strong and fierce in their own right. Given that, I&#x2019;ve got to call out the heavy artillery.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You <i>are</i> the heavy artillery, Zeke. Isn&#x2019;t that the whole point of a Necrodemian? You kill the big evil.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes and no. There are roughly one hundred known demons who are beyond our abilities to battle and kill. Those who have origins so powerful and old that they have been sealed away and are supposed to stay there. For this level of demon, we need nuclear-devastation capabilities. Only one of his ilk can battle him and put him back in his bottle without dying in the process.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wait. You&#x2019;re not proposing we summon a stronger, more <i>evil</i> demon to capture him?&#x201d;</p> <p>Zeke was about to draw Thorn into a horrific mess. More than anyone, Karma knew what a bad idea that was. The last thing Thorn needed was temptation. Everyday, he was slipping toward the realm of his father, she could feel it every time they talked. But Zeke was right. What choice did they have?</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, we don&#x2019;t call the Hellchasers out often. They&#x2019;re like rabid dogs, and we&#x2019;re usually fighting them as well as the gruesomes. However, it&#x2019;s the only option in this case. Unless you want Valac free to roam, and I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea, especially with Halloween coming. Just hang tight, and I&#x2019;ll be there as soon as I can.&#x201d;</p> <p>Karma hung up the phone as she scanned the room where she warehoused and cleansed some of the scariest relics and items in the paranormal realm. She&#x2019;d never wanted to keep Valac, but when her sister Tiyana had died, she&#x2019;d inherited his guardianship. Tiyana had made her promise that should anything happen to her, Karma wouldn&#x2019;t entrust his container to anyone else. Not for any reason.</p> <p>Now&nbsp;&#x2026;</p> <p><i>Please don&#x2019;t let this be the worst mistake of my life.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Sherrilyn Kenyon</p></p><h2>Witness in Heaven (The Appomattox Saga, Book 10)</h2><p>Providing a twist on the Pygmalion tale, Morris encloses a tender romance within the epic battles fought in war-ravaged Virginia.</p><p></p><h2>Unravelling the Franklin Mystery: Inuit Testimony (Mcgill-Queen&#39;s Native and Northern Series)</h2><p>David Woodman&#39;s reconstruction of the mysterious events surrounding the tragic Franklin expedition boldly challenges standard interpretations and promises to replace them. Among the many who have tried to discover the truth behind the Franklin disaster, Woodman is the first to recognise the profound importance of the Inuit testimony and to analyse it in depth. He concludes from his investigations that the Inuit probably did visit Franklin&#39;s ships while the crew was still on board and that there were some Inuit who actually saw the sinking of one of the ships. He maintains that fewer than ten bodies were found at Starvation Cove and that the last survivors left the cove in 1851, three years after the standard account assumes them to be dead. Woodman also disputes the conclusion of Owen Beattie and John Geiger&#39;s book &#34;Frozen in time&#34; that lead poisoning was a major contributing cause of the disaster.Much of the Inuit testimony presented in &#34;Unravelling the Franklin Mystery&#34; has never before been published. The earliest Woodman quotes was recorded by Franklin searchers only nine years after the disappearance of the Franklin team. Inuit testimony provided Woodman with the pivotal clue in his re-construction of the puzzle of the Franklin disaster: &#39;I proceeded from the assumption that all Inuit stories concerning white men should have a discoverable factual basis ...and managed to discover a scenario which allowed use of all the native recollections, solved some troubling discrepancies in the physical evidence and led to some significant new conclusions as to the fate of the beleaguered sailors&#39;. Whether or not one agrees with Woodman&#39;s conclusions, his account is compelling and his analysis impressive.</p><p>CA&#34;Undoubtedly the most authoritative, cool-headed and thrilling investigation so far&#34; Jonathan Keates The Observer &#34;Woodman has examined all the documentation on Inuit testimony with relentless thoroughness. He has made a vitally important, long overdue contribution ...It is a book anyone obsessed with Franklin will want to have&#34; Toronto Star &#34;Compelling reading&#34; Books in Canada &#34;Woodman is an indefatigable and creative researcher, and gifted in the ability to convey dauntless enthusiasm for the obscure hieroglyphs that Franklin&#39;s history left us in its wake.&#34; Arctic Circle &#34;Woodman&#39;s book will be invaluable to those who can&#39;t get enough on the Franklin mystery.&#34; Montreal Gazette &#34;Brilliant ... a joy to read ...it unfolds slowly like a good detective story.

Stuart Houston, University of Saskatchewan and editor of The Arctic Ordeal and To the Arctic by Canoe &#34;[Woodman] has done an excellent job of gathering Inuit testimony and he presents a new emphasis which allows new interpretations and conclusions with regard to the Franklin epic. Such an approach should fit in with the new genre of book which seeks to look back into history and present a native perspective.&#34; Dorothy Harley Eber, author of When the Whalers were up North</p><h2>Stitched Together, Stories for the Quilter&#39;s Soul, Volume 1</h2><p>Stitched Together is a compilation of stories written by regular folks like you and me whose lives have been touched by quilting.

They go along their merry way and suddenly think, Oh, it's dark outside. They are truly unaware of how the shadows thicken and begin to ooze toward each other, merging, melding, clasping their invisible hands together to unite and flow forward to surround us. They rarely notice that the birds have retreated to their quiet places within the inky corners of the forest, nesting calmly with patience and optimism. Birds don't suffer through nightmares as I often do. They believe the sun will always return and the clouds will eventually be gone. All that they know, they have inherited. They do not separate their knowledge from themselves. It is who or what they are and they are comfortable with all of it. You can see their contentment and their confidence in the way they fly. </p><p> I envy them for that, for their comfort but mostly for their self-assurance, their wonderful trust in themselves and in the promises Nature makes, whether it is the promise of the seasons, the promise of the rain, or the promise of the sun itself. They glide and slice through their day, carving a world of beauty for themselves. </p><p> Mrs. Westington said that even though we are the more complex and the higher form of life for which all of this supposedly has been created, we still covet the simplicity that animals, that even insects enjoy. Their lives are so uncomplicated. </p><p> "They don't need the guidance of the Ten Commandments in order to avoid sin," she said. </p><p> "But," I asked, "are they capable of real happiness or do they just plod along in a mechanical manner? Do they have ambitions? Do they dream and hope? Do birds, rabbits, foxes, and snakes smile? Do they really ever experience rapture, ecstasy, contentment?" </p><p> "Oh, I don't know if they do or if it even matters. More important," Mrs. Westington replied, "you should ask, do we? We have our moments, even our days," she said, "but it doesn't last. Before long, we're envious of others or we're upset with someone we love or we're bored, disgusted, and disappointed. Notice the coming of night?" she asked when I'd mentioned my thought, punctuating her reply with her tiny, coughlike laugh. "Most of us don't even notice the day, much less stop to smell the roses or look up at the stars in awe of their dazzling beauty. My husband was oblivious like that. He never stopped to enjoy what he had. He was always in pursuit of something more and it was never enough. I wonder if he found enough in the grave." </p><p> Sometimes for hours, I listened to her ramble on, moving from one topic to the next, dropping her tidbits of wisdom with the grace and generosity of a loving mother feeding her newborns in the nest. She lectured authoritatively, like a professor in the school of hard knocks. When she got too despondent or waved a tattered flag of lifelong regrets, her loyal employee of fifty years, Trevor Washington, would just shake his head and say, "You c'mon now, Mrs. Westington. None of that doom and gloom talk or you'll scare the poor girl outta here." </p><p> Most of the time she ignored him or dismissed him with a short wave of her hand. </p><p> And the only other person who lived in the old vineyard home, her fourteen-year-old granddaughter, Echo, was deaf, and in many ways a birdlike creature herself, hovering in her private corners waiting for a song she would never hear sung. </p><p> Mrs. Westington had invited me to move in and live with them to help her with Echo and be Echo's companion. Echo's mother, Mrs. Westington's daughter, Rhona, had left Echo here more than ten years ago and Echo was without any brother or sister, any friends or any parent. I couldn't imagine a lonelier person than Echo, who had already been locked away within the four walls of silence. </p><p> "My daughter named her Echo when the doctor said her baby was deaf. 'It'll be like hearing yourself whenever you talk to her. It's a perfect name for her,' she told me when I complained," Mrs. Westington said. "Truth is, I kinda like her name now." </p><p> "It's different. I like it, too," I told her. </p><p> "I knew you would. I knew you would be a good friend to her, too. She should have a friend. Goodness knows, that poor girl longs for a real companion." </p><p> What I soon realized, however, was that Mrs. Westington needed me as much as Echo did. She was brimful of wisdom and a lifetime of experiences she desperately had to share with someone she loved. I like that. I like the feeling of being important to someone and loved. Even when Daddy and Mama and my older sister, Brenda, and I were all still together, I didn't feel as needed as I felt here in the old house and vineyard property in northern California. </p><p> A wrong turn onto a dead-end road brought me to this place and to these people. After my mother's death, which wasn't all that long after my father's secret fatal illness, I had gone to live with Brenda and her lover, Celia. Both attended college in Memphis, where Brenda had won an athletic scholarship. Like my parents, I ignored any thoughts about Brenda's being gay. I had no doubts that my parents knew it to be true but kept it locked in their hearts. I was afraid to ask any questions, afraid that the same questions might someday be asked of me, afraid that on the back of my neck I would feel the breeze of all that whispering. </p><p> My deep unhappiness after Mama's passing and then a traumatic sexual incident with Celia sent me fleeing to my uncle Palaver, my mother's brother, for emotional asylum. Before I came here to Mrs. Westington's home, I had been living and traveling for months with my uncle. He was a magician and an excellent ventriloquist who mainly went from theater to theater in his motor home to perform. I soon realized that he suffered from serious alcoholism brought on by his own deep sorrow over the loss of his beloved companion, the African American woman called Destiny. She had been part of his act, but more important, a big part of his life. </p><p> One night after I had been with him a while, he died in the rear of his motor home, lying beside the replica of Destiny, a life-size doll he employed in his show after her passing. Even though I feared it would happen because I witnessed how much he drank and how often, it was still a horrible shock to find him dead in his bed, his arms around the naked doll. From the smile on his face, I was positive he died convinced he had found her again. </p><p> Mrs. Westington believed all this was meant to be, was fated, especially my arrival here, and I must say she persuaded me. I felt delivered, guided, and directed to this place. Mrs. Westington's theory was that our loved ones who have passed away remain with us for a time and have an influence on our lives. </p><p> "They do their best to watch over us and lead us to happiness," she said. "But only if they were good people," she added. "How good they were determines how long they can be with us to protect us. That's what the Bible really means when we read, 'The sins of the father are visited on the heads of his sons.' If he was a sinner, then his sons have no guardian angel, you see, and no one to protect and insulate them against the weight of all those sins and their consequences. In that sense, they suffer. Your mama and your papa must have been good people. They're still watching over you." </p><p> I liked that. I liked her interpretation of Scripture. However, Mrs. Westington was really not a Bible-thumping, religion-driven woman. In fact, she often went into tirades about the corruption of the clergy and the troubles in the world that religions visited on each other. She said it would take a tow truck to get her to church and she'd dig ditches with her heels all the way. She was very opinionated and very confident of all her opinions. When she went into one of her diatribes, she often made me laugh. Sometimes, she wanted to, but sometimes, I could see she was surprised herself at my smile. </p><p> "I'm serious, girl," she'd say, and widen her eyes, often followed by a quick, hard tap with her cane. That long, old hickory stick with its pearl handle was something Trevor Washington had made for her. She told me he made it, "Two seconds after I began to wobble." </p><p> "Oh, I know you're serious, Mrs. Westington," I told her, and she grunted with skepticism. "I do and I'm not laughing at you!" I insisted. </p><p> I didn't want to upset her. She'd been so kind to me. She helped me with my uncle's funeral arrangements and supported me during the whole ordeal. Brenda, now a professional athlete, was off to Germany for a basketball tournament the day after Uncle Palaver died. It all fell on my head. I knew she thought my problems were my own making. I shouldn't have run away after she had found her girlfriend, Celia, with me, but that wasn't my fault and I couldn't stand the dark cloud of Brenda's anger hovering over me. I couldn't stomach the thought of living with her while she despised me. I felt like a lead weight on her ankles anyway. Having the responsibility for a young teenage sister just when she was developing her own promising athletic career was a burden she surely would rather unload. </p><p> Even so, even after all that, when Mrs. Westington had asked me to move in, I was nervous and undecided. After all, she, Trevor, and Echo were complete strangers to me and I had been on the property less than a day. I quickly saw, however, that when Mrs. Westington made up her mind about something, she went forward "whole hog," as she would say, even though it was something she had not pondered long. </p><p> "No one should be impulsive and fall between the devil and the deep blue sea, but we don't live long enough to waste time," she lectured at dinner, where most of her lectures took place. "When you reach my age, you realize that even more. Your heart is like one of them parking meters. God puts a few coins in and you tick away, but that expired sign is climbing and old man Death is getting ready to give me a ticket. I can see his grumpy old face forming in the fog just outside the windows of my very soul." </p><p> The expression on her face, the way she focused her...</p></p><h2>Repertory of the Homeopathic Materia Medica</h2><p>This fundamental work written by Dr. James Tyler Kent is offered to the profession as a basic Repertory and is a compilation of all the useful symptoms recorded in the fundamental work of our Materia Medica as well as from the notes of pioneers of homeopathy.

His elementary and secondary education was acquired in Franklin Academy, Prattsburg, and his higher education in Madison (now Colgate) University, Hamilton, New York, where he came to his degree, Ph.B., in 1868; A.M., 1870. He was educated in medicine in the Eclectic Medical Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio, graduating there in 1871, and the Homoeopathic Medical College of Missouri, St. Louis, where he was awarded the diploma of that institution in 1889. Dr. Kent began his professional career in St. Louis as a Physician of the eclectic school at the same time being actively connected with several eclectic journals in the capacity of writer and also took an earnest part in the councils of the Eclectic National College, St. Louis, 1877-78, about which time his attention was forcibly directed to homoeopathy, through the serious illness of his wife, whose case refused to yield to the treatment either of his own eclectic or the allopathic school practitioners, but was subdued by homoeopathic treatment. Later on he was dean and professor of Materia Medica in the Post-Graduate School of Homoeopathics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; dean and professor of material medica in Dunham Medical College, Chicago; dean and professor of material medica inj Hering Medical College, Chicago; and in 1905 he held the same chair in Hahnemann Medical College, Chicago.</p><h2>On Beyond Zebra (Dr Seuss)</h2><p>In this rip-roaring story a young boy delights in explaining how his alphabet starts where our alphabet ends. Carrying on beyond Z for zebra, we find letter Yuzz for Yuzz-a-ma-Tuzz, and Glikk as in Glikker, who lives in wild weeds and spends his time juggling with cinnamon seeds...With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Seuss has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic Cat in the Hat, and ranked among the UK&#39;s top ten favourite children&#39;s authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with over 650 million books sold worldwide.As part of a major rebrand programme, HarperCollins is relaunching Dr. Seuss&#39;s best-selling books. In response to consumer demand, bright new cover designs incorporate much-needed guidance on reading levels. The standard paperbacks divide into three reading strands - Blue Back Books for parents to share with young children, Green Back Books for budding readers to tackle on their own, and Yellow Back Books for older, more fluent readers to enjoy. This is a Yellow Back book.</p><p>A thoroughly Seussian tweak of the alphabet-book tradition, <i>On Beyond Zebra</i> is about all the letters that most people ignore--the ones that come after Z. Our hero (instantly recognizable to most Seuss fans as the boy who captured Thing One and Thing Two in <i>The Cat in the Hat</i>) takes his young friend, Conrad Cornelius O'Donald O'Dell, on a guided tour of all the weird creatures that begin with letters such as <i>Yuzz</i>, <i>Wumbus</i>, and <i>Glikk</i>. "And Nuh is the letter I use to spell Nutches, Who live in small caves, known as Nitches, for hutches." The message is pretty simple: the alphabet pins down boring old "reality," but if you explore further afield there are more interesting worlds to discover. "So, on beyond Z! It's high time you were shown, / That you really don't know all there is to be known." Explorers in need of guidance will even find a table of useful new letters (a <i>beyondabet</i>? a <i>WumbaGlikk</i>?) in the back. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Richard Farr</i>lor.

There the family sits near the corner wood stove and listens, uninterrupting, as Uncle David tells stories--of the old country, of old times, of a semi-mythical lumberjack. Eldon, the younger son, begins his own story, in spring, when everything is soft. While he describes for readers the farm activities of each season and narrates memorable pranks and milestones of his boyhood, it is the palpable awareness of place and character that is unforgettable. Paulsen, with a simple intensity, brings to consciousness the texture, the smells, the light and shadows of each distinct season. He has penned a mood poem in prose. Uncle David's final story precipitates within the brothers a fuller understanding of personal identity and integrity. For those special readers who find delight in The Winter Room, it will become a part of their own identity and understanding. Teachers who seek to illuminate the use of ordinary English words with extraordinary descriptive power will find the introductory chapter, in particular, to be a godsend. --Katharine Bruner, Brown Middle School, Harrison, TN<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hand Job: A Catalog of Type</h2><p>In this digital age of computer-generated graphics and typography, it's refreshing to find typographers who still believe in working by hand.

This part of the United States is, after all, the "buckle" of the Bible Belt. In her surprising history, <i>Southern Cross,</i> Professor Christine Leigh Heyrman shows that Evangelical Christianity was not always as popular in the South as it is today. In fact, the whole face of Evangelicalism has changed radically since its introduction in the 18th century. For example, early teaching and practice resoundingly opposed slavery, class privilege, and the traditional roles of men and women. Evangelicals encouraged women's involvement in church affairs and--even worse--spiritual intimacy with other races. These unpopular political and social stands combined with their unbending view of hellfire and damnation placed Evangelicals on the margins of Southern religious practice until they themselves were "converted" to a different set of traditional values. <p> Heyrman's book traces the evolution of Southern Evangelism from fringe movement to possessor of the Southern soul. In the span of a century, Evangelicalism began adopting Southern values, and a sect that had earlier preached against slavery and violence began defending both slaveholding and succession from the Union and the use of force in these ends, if necessary. The story of Christianity in the South is a fascinating one, and <i>Southern Cross</i> tells it well.</p>"An extraordinarily rich exploration of the first hundred years of evangelical faith in the South. . . . Heyrman has given us a great deal to think about in this wonderfully told and beautifully written story. In the end, we are left to ponder what the South, and indeed the United States, might look like today if those 18th-century evangelical firebrands with their message of freedom for slaves and recognition for women had managed to carry the day."--Charles B.

And yet in the nine decades since her death, next to nothing has been written about this extraordinary woman aside from juvenile biographies. The truth about Harriet Tubman has become lost inside a legend woven of racial and gender stereotypes. Now at last, in this long-overdue biography, historian Kate Clifford Larson gives Harriet Tubman the powerful, intimate, meticulously detailed life she deserves.<br><br>Drawing from a trove of new documents and sources as well extensive genealogical research, Larson reveals Tubman as a complex woman&#x2014; brilliant, shrewd, deeply religious, and passionate in her pursuit of freedom. The descendant of the vibrant, matrilineal Asanti people of the West African Gold Coast, Tubman was born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of Maryland but refused to spend her life in bondage. While still a young woman she embarked on a perilous journey of self-liberation&#x2014;and then, having won her own freedom, she returned again and again to liberate family and friends, tapping into the Underground Railroad. <br><br>Yet despite her success, her celebrity, her close ties with Northern politicians and abolitionists, Tubman suffered crushing physical pain and emotional setbacks. Stripping away myths and misconceptions, Larson presents stunning new details about Tubman&#x2019;s accomplishments, personal life, and influence, including her relationship with Frederick Douglass, her involvement with John Brown&#x2019;s raid on Harpers Ferry, and revelations about a young woman who may have been Tubman&#x2019;s daughter. Here too are Tubman&#x2019;s twilight years after the war, when she worked for women&#x2019;s rights and in support of her fellow blacks, and when racist politicians and suffragists marginalized her contribution.<br><br>Harriet Tubman, her life and her work, remain an inspiration to all who value freedom. Now, thanks to Larson&#x2019;s breathtaking biography, we can finally appreciate Tubman as a complete human being&#x2014;an American hero, yes, but also a woman who loved, suffered, and sacrificed. <i>Bound for the Promised Land</i> is a magnificent work of biography, history, and truth telling.</p><p>&#x201c;What a glorious book! Kate Clifford Larson&#x2019;s magnificent biography of the life of the real Harriet Tubman deserves the nation&#x2019;s attention. . . . With clarity, grace, and skill, Larson brilliantly captures the truly remarkable spirit of a genuine American heroine.

Turning Points historical graphic novels bring these moments in American history to life.</b> <br> <br> When Owen and Amos Bennington's mother and father, vocal abolitionists, are killed in 1856, the brothers are driven to continue their parents' quest. However, each sees a different path: The elder brother, Owen, volunteers to help Abraham Lincoln, while Amos is filled with fire and joins up with violent abolitionist John Brown. Ultimately, Amos and Owen reunite for a thrilling moment in Lincoln's personal and our country's political history.</p><p>Grade 5&#x2013;7&#x2014;When Owen and Amos Bennington's abolitionist parents are murdered in 1856, each brother takes a different path toward ending slavery. Owen goes to Springfield, IL, to work on Abraham Lincoln's election, while Amos joins John Brown's campaign. Scenes of violence against abolitionists effectively illustrate the risks involved in fighting slavery, and this fictional account helps to dramatize and highlight a part of history that needs attention. The dialogue is occasionally pedantic: definitions of political parties and the Fugitive Slave Law are awkwardly inserted into conversation. The illustrations are expressive and assured, however, and the handwritten lettering gives the story an informal feel. There is no bibliography to assure readers of the accuracy behind the story's history. Still, this is an accessible introduction to the period, and a light supplement to more substantial texts on the topic.&#x2014;<i>Lisa Goldstein, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His feeling of being unloved found constant confirmation in his changing experiences over the years, and the intensity of his unsatisfied desire to be loved, detectable as a dominant wish throughout his life, very largely determined what had meaning for him and what did not."&#x2014;From the book<br><br>One of the most important social thinkers of our time provides a haunting portrait of Mozart's life and creative genius. German sociologist Norbert Elias examines the paradoxes in Mozart's short existence&#x2014;his brilliant creativity and social marginality, his musical sophistication and personal crudeness, his breathtaking accomplishments and deep despair.<br><br>Using psychoanalytic insights, Elias examines Leopold Mozart's carefully honed ambitions for his son and protege. From the age of six Mozart traveled with his father, performing in the major courts throughout Europe. The elder Mozart worked on his son "like a sculptor on his sculpture," and this deep bond formed the lietmotif in understanding Mozart's early talent and complicated psyche.<br><br>Mozart chafed at the constraints of Viennese courtly culture. Growing up in a society which viewed musicians as manual laborers producing entertainment for the court, he fought for an independent livelihood. Vienna's aristocracy ultimately turned its back on the composer, who faced mounting debts, no work, and no prospect of fulfilling his innermost desires. He died feeling that his life had become empty of meaning.<br><br>Elias ponders the concept of genius, which he sees as a complex marriage of fantasy, inspiration, and convention. In exploring the tension between personal creativity and the tastes of an era, he gives us a book of startling insight and discovery.</p><p><b>Norbert Elias</b> was Professor Emeritus at the University of Frankfurt until his death in 1990.

Yet, Monmow Disease, a life-threatening condition that transforms a person into a dog-like beast, is not the only villain in this shocking triumph of a medical thriller by manga-god Osamu Tezuka. Said to have been the personal favorite of the artist, who held a degree in medicine, and surprisingly attentive to Christian themes and imagery, <i>Ode to Kirihito</i> demolishes naive notions about human nature and health and likely preconceptions about the comics master himself.<br><br>From pregnant vistas of the Japanese countryside to closed rooms full of sin and redemption, Tezuka astounds for more than eight hundred continuous pages, his art in turn easefully concise and flamboyantly experimental, his inquiry into our most repugnant instincts and prospects for overcoming them unflinchingly serious. Incorporating elements of the often lurid and adult-oriented &#x201c;gekiga&#x201d; style for the first time, Tezuka entered into his fruitful late period with this work.<br><br>A promising young doctor, Kirihito Osanai visits a remote Japanese mountain village to investigate the source of the latest medical mystery. While he ends up traveling the world to discover what it takes to be cured of such a disease, a conspiracy back home attempts to explain away his absence. Hinging upon his fate are those of his loved ones: an unstable childhood friend and colleague trapped between factions of the medical establishment that nurtured him; a fianc�e emotionally transformed by Kirihito&#x2019;s mysterious disappearance; and a stranger who becomes his guardian angel, a sensual circus-act performer with volatile psychological secrets. <br><br>From plutocratic Taipei and racially divided South Africa to backwater Arabia and modern Osaka, ambition and desire beckon &#x201c;normal men&#x201d; to behave uglier than any beast. Riveting our attention on deformity and its acceptance like <i>The Elephant Man</i> by David Lynch, <i>Ode to Kirihito</i> examines the true worth of human beings through and beyond appearances.</p><p><b>Osamu Tezuka</b> (1928-1989) is the godfather of Japanese manga comics. He originally intended to become a doctor and earned his degree before turning to what was still then considered a frivolous medium. With his sweeping vision, deftly intertwined plots, and indefatigable commitment to human dignity, Tezuka elevated manga to an art form. His eight-volume epic <i>Buddha</i>, winner of the Eisner and Harvey Awards, is also available from Vertical.<i>Starred Review.</i> Tezuka earned the nickname "godfather of manga" not just by the length and prolificacy of his career but by the moral commitment he brought to such projects as the award-winning <i>Buddha</i>. His works deal with the most profound questions of human existence. <i>Kirihito</i> combines medical melodrama and anguished debates about guilt and redemption. The hero, complacent Dr. Osanai Kirihito, believes he's been assigned to study people suffering from a new, fatal disease that degrades them into doglike beasts. When the transformation hits him, too, he realizes that the cause is not what he was told and that the condition can be controlled. However, Kirihito soon finds out how violently society reacts to anyone who looks different. He also discovers that the medical establishment has betrayed him and now wants him to disappear permanently. Fleeing through episodes of brutal exploitation, he tries to find a place where he can function as a human being; he winds up as a combination of Jesus Christ and the Count of Monte Cristo. While Kirihito struggles with himself and other vividly drawn characters, the operatic plot swirls from one passionate scene to the next, reinforced by Tezuka's apparently simple but strikingly expressive line work. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Edwin Hoyt, World War II scholar and author, argues against the U. S. justification of the bombing. In his new book, <i>Inferno</i>, Hoyt shows how the U.

Hoyt accuses Major General Curtis LeMay, the Air Force leader who helped plan the destruction of Dresden, of committing a war crime through his plan to burn Japan's major cities to the ground. <br><br>The firebombing raids conducted by LeMay's squadrons caused far more death than the two atomic blasts. Throughout cities built largely from wood, incendiary bombs started raging fires that consumed houses and killed hundreds of thousands of men, women and children. The survivors of the raids recount their stories in <i>Inferno</i>, remembering their terror as they fled to shelter through burning cities, escaping smoke, panicked crowds, and collapsing buildings. <br><br>Hoyt's descriptions of the widespread death and destruction of Japan depicts a war machine operating without restraint. <i>Inferno</i> offers a provocative look at what may have been America's most brutal policy during the years of World War II.</p><p>Edwin P.

So virulent was the sentiment against Catholics that, in 1780, violent riots erupted in London&#x2014;incited by the anti-Papist Lord George Gordon&#x2014;in response to the Act for Relief that had been passed to loosen some of these restrictions. <br><br> The Gordon Riots marked a crucial turning point in the fight for Catholic emancipation. Over the next fifty years, factions battled to reform the laws of the land. Kings George III and George IV refused to address the &#x201c;Catholic Question,&#x201d; even when pressed by their prime ministers. But in 1829, through the dogged work of charismatic Irish lawyer Daniel O&#x2019;Connell and the support of the great Duke of Wellington, the watershed Roman Catholic Relief Act finally passed, opening the door to the radical transformation of the Victorian age.

The sky was like blood with the reflection of the fires&#x2019;<br></i><br> -Lady Anne Erskine, Clerkenwell, 1780<br> The story begins with violence: in the summer of 1780 London was the scene of the worst riots the city had ever ex-perienced, and which were to prove the &#x2018;largest, deadliest and most protracted urban riots in British history&#x2019;. The death toll was probably about 1,000 people altogether (in proportion to the population of the capital, this remains the highest percentage of deaths in a riot yet known). The physical damage to the structure of the city would not be surpassed until the Blitz in the Second World War. Known to history as the Gordon Riots &#x2013; famously commemorated by Dickens in <i>Barnaby Rudge, </i>when he wrote of &#x2018;a moral plague&#x2019; running through the city &#x2013; they were deliberately initiated by the militantly Anti-Catholic son of a Scottish duke, who was a Member of the British Parliament.<br> &nbsp;<br> Riots were certainly not unknown in eighteenth-century London: there had been the so-called Wilkes Riots in the 1760s and the Keppel Riots after that; but in degree of violence, the Gordon Riots excelled them. Symbols of the State were attacked. Ten Downing Street, already the official residence of the Prime Minister, Lord North, was assaulted at two o&#x2019;clock in the morn�ing by protesters bearing lighted flambeaux and faggots: they had to be driven off by twenty dragoons on horseback. Meanwhile the Prime Minister&#x2019;s dinner guests climbed onto the roof in order to see the fires burning as far as the horizon.<br> &nbsp;<br> If prime ministers were obvious targets for attack, private individuals were not safe either. Lady Anne Erskine was a Scot�tish lady living quietly in a house attached to Spa Fields Chapel in Clerkenwell. She wrote: &#x2018;Such a scene my eyes never beheld, and I pray God I never may again. The situation of the place which is high and very open gave us an awful prospect of it. We were surrounded by flames. Six different fires &#x2013; with that of Newgate towering to the clouds . . . with every hour we were in expectation of this house and chapel making the seventh. The sky was like blood with the reflection of the fires.&#x2019; Ten years later, the literary Ladies of Llangollen, gazing at a fierce crimson sunset, were still irresistibly reminded of the Gordon Riots.<br> &nbsp;<br> Susanna, sister of another literary lady, Fanny Burney, was living just off Leicester Fields (the modern Leicester Square); the house had formerly belonged to Sir Isaac Newton and still had his old observatory attached. From here the twenty-five-year-old Susanna heard the violent shouts and huzzas as all the furniture of their neighbour was piled up in the square, and his servant forced to bring a candle to light the bonfire: &#x2018;my knees went knicky knocky,&#x2019; she confessed. The next night was worse. She watched another house in her own street totally emptied and set alight. The rioters, covered in smoke and dust, looked like &#x2018;so many Infernals&#x2019; in the firelight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly the little group in the window, consisting of Susanna, her sister Esther and brother-in-law, caught the attention of the crowd below: &#x2018;They are all three Papists!&#x2019; was the cry. It was a dangerous acclamation. &#x2018;Call out <i>No Popery </i>or anything,&#x2019; said Esther urgently to her husband. (They were not in fact Catholics.) In a similar fashion, the Jews in Houndsditch would inscribe &#x2018;This house is a true Protestant&#x2019; on their dwellings to preserve themselves. One foreigner simply wrote &#x2018;No Religion&#x2019; outside his own house, although he also more explicitly draped himself in the blue ribbons of the rioters in the cause of self-preservation.<br> &nbsp;<br> The mere word &#x2018;Popery&#x2019; was in fact inflammatory in its own style. Many of the ignorant crowd, when not seriously bent on plunder as such crowds tend to be, were aware of &#x2018;Popery&#x2019; as an evil which needed to be restrained (with &#x2018;Papists&#x2019; being those who practised it) without seeking any further information. There were 10,000 stout fellows, as Daniel Defoe had written earlier in the century in <i>The Behaviour of Servants, </i>who would spend their last drop of blood against Popery but &#x2018;do not know whether it be a man or a horse&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> An illustration of this was the bewilderment of a certain group at the time of the actual Riots when called to attack a house &#x2018;as there were <i>Catholics </i>there&#x2019;. They replied: &#x2018;What are Catholics to us? We are against <i>Popery</i>.&#x2019; Maria Edgeworth, in her novel featur�ing these events, <i>Harrington, </i>picked on another area of ignorance. A certain woman observer was amazed at the assault on a par�ticular carriage, and the breaking of the windows of a house; for surely these were not &#x2018;Romans&#x2019;. When assured they were: &#x2018;How is that, when they&#x2019;re not Irish? For I&#x2019;ll swear to they&#x2019;re not being Irish . . .&#x2019; This particular mob responded with lethal simplicity: &#x2018;We require the Papists to be given up for your lives,&#x2019; and then added for good measure: &#x2018;No Jews! No wooden shoes!&#x2019; This was the kind of mindless cruelty which was responsible for the deliberate incineration of the canaries belonging to a rich silk merchant named Malo, on the grounds that they were &#x2018;Popish birds&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> From her observation post, Susanna&#x2019;s heart ached for her Catholic friends, mainly Italians (she was having a delicate romance with an Italian singer at the time). They could not even venture to complain about the destruction of their houses and property because their religion made them so vulnerable. Instead, they mainly took their suspicious foreign names off the door, and one even put his own <i>No Popery </i>notice on it. The summit of the crowd&#x2019;s wilful, even absurd destruction occurred when a house was attacked &#x2013; just because the notices outside were in French. <br> &nbsp;<br> These ferocious riots were in fact a protest against the Catholic Relief Act which had received the Royal Assent of George III in June 1778. It might legitimately be supposed that this Relief Act had enacted widespread, even revolutionary, relaxation of the Penal Laws against Roman Catholics, to provoke such a scabrous assault. In fact the Relief was relatively mild. It was the reaction which was extreme. <br> &nbsp;<br> To sum up the actual state of the law in England and Scotland before June 1778 (the laws in Ireland were a separate matter at this point): first of all, no Catholic could receive political office, neither in the House of Lords nor the House of Commons, or engage in anything else of an official nature. No Catholic in England and Scotland was allowed to buy or inherit land. Exer�cising the function of a Catholic priest or running a Catholic school were both activities punishable by life imprisonment. Catholics could not receive commissions in the army or navy, or officially be soldiers or sailors. In the same way, Catholics who declared themselves as such could not attend universities, let alone take degrees.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was one prohibition in particular with enormous potential social consequences. Even if both bride and groom were Catholics, they could not get married legally by a Catholic priest in a Catholic church: such a ceremony would have no status under the law, with all the consequent penalties. The Marriage Act of 1753, which had relaxed the rules for other dissenting religions, left out the Catholics. For Catholics, in order to avoid complications to do with inheritance and other matters, there had to be an alternative (Protestant) ceremony, even if the par�ticipants by definition regarded these vows as empty. <br> &nbsp;<br> Inheritance was, in fact, another awkward question. There were penal tax laws. Catholics could not in theory inherit prop�erty &#x2013; giving rise to the unpleasant possibility of one member of the family declaring adherence to the official Protestant religion of the State, and demanding to inherit property otherwise des�tined for a Catholic heir. Six years before the passage of the Act for Relief, the case of the Widow Fenwick became notorious. The Catholic heiress Anne Benson had married the Protestant John Fenwick. When Fenwick died, his Protestant brother claimed his sister-in-law&#x2019;s property with no other justification than her proscribed religion. Mrs Fenwick was fortunate: she attracted the attention of the benevolent Lord Camden, and finally she secured a settlement by a private Act of Parliament.6 But the threat remained, and it was a genuine threat under the law.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were minor issues: religious dress &#x2013; that of nuns, monks and priests &#x2013; could not lawfully be worn in the streets. Ostenta�tious signs of the Catholic religion, such as the sound of bells being tolled at Catholic chapels, were specifically forbidden. Furthermore, there is an important clue to the world which lay beyond the arid sentences of the law: anyone who chose to provide information leading to the conviction of a Catholic priest could expect a payment of �100 (about �7,500 today). Nor had this law been a dead letter in recent years: in 1767 the Informers Act was used to secure the successful prosecution of a priest. The informer was one William Payne, who made a living out of such dubious activities. As a result of this denunciation a certain Father Maloney was sentenced to life imprisonment, although subsequently released after four years with a Royal Pardon on condition he left the country to become &#x2018;an exile for Christ&#x2019;, in the words of a Catholic bishop.<br> &nbsp;<br> What then did this Act for Relief, so savagely resented, provide for? First and perhaps most importantly, the laws concerning the arrest and prosecution of Catholic priests were repealed, and the keeping of a Catholic school was no longer punishable by life imprisonment. Catholics could buy land and inherit it just like anyone else, according to the laws of the country, without the potential menace of a Protestant heir, however remote, intervening. All of this affected the lives of ordinary people, or at any rate those prominent enough in society to attract the attention of the land law.<br> &nbsp;<br> The existence, however, of that notorious controlling author�ity, the foreign Pope, was not ignored. Catholics were now explicitly commanded in a new Oath of Allegiance to deny that the Pope had any &#x2018;temporal&#x2019; (worldly) jurisdiction as opposed to spiritual authority; which meant that the Pope could not any more declare Catholics able to murder their &#x2018;heretic&#x2019; Protestant princes (or princesses) without sin. The Pope was also no longer allowed to absolve Catholics from keeping faith with heretics &#x2013; in so far as he ever had. On the positive side, there were to be prayers for the King in the Catholic churches and chapels newly freed from their illegal status.<br> &nbsp;<br> The leader &#x2013; the initiator &#x2013; of the ferocious protests against this mild relaxation of the Anti-Catholic laws was a curious individual even to his contemporaries. Lord George Gordon&#x2019;s unusual appearance &#x2013; long red hair to his shoulders, and slightly protuberant blue eyes &#x2013; added to the startling impression which he left upon observers, and inspired Horace Walpole to call him &#x2018;the lunatic apostle&#x2019;. Whether it detracted from the effect he had, or secretly added to it, Gordon had the reputation of a libertine in his private life. It was significant that when he denounced the Protestant Archbishop of Canterbury as &#x2018;the Whore of Babylon&#x2019; for his Catholic sympathies, a wit commented that this particular whore was the only whore that Gordon disliked. <br> &nbsp;<br> Lord George was the sixth child of the Duke of Gordon. His education at Eton College was conventional, a note of eccentricity in his family circle being struck by his mother, the Duchess: on being widowed, she chose to marry a young American soldier. It was the Duchess who decided on her son&#x2019;s early career in the navy. Lord George was twenty-nine at the time of the Gordon Riots, and had been a Member of Parliament for Ludgershall in Wiltshire since the age of twenty-two: it was a seat, in the un- reformed House of Commons, which had been bought for him by General Simon Fraser, the Member of Parliament for Inverness.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gordon was a complicated character. His fierce hostility to the idea of Catholic Relief should be contrasted with other views which would be considered positively liberal in the modern sense of the word (liberal used here as an adjective, meaning generous and tolerant, would come to be used in a critical political sense: but there was no Liberal Party as yet in Britain). Undoubtedly possessing great personal charm, he was kind and tender to his social inferiors. Mistreatment of the sailors during his naval career appalled him and he said so: he was &#x2018;the sailor&#x2019;s friend&#x2019;, in the words of a biography written shortly after his death. Visiting Jamaica, he studied the conditions in which the inhabitants lived and was indignant at what he called &#x2018;the bloody treatment of the negroes&#x2019;. In America, by way of contrast, he admired the free-and-easy way of life and independent spirit which he found in the people. Later, as an MP, influenced by Burke, he was marked by his violent opposition to the &#x2018;mad, cruel and accursed American war&#x2019; against the would-be independent colonies.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was also a man who, as the son of a duke, felt entitled to call on King George III, and exercised his birthright twice. In the second of the two interviews, he chose to indulge himself in a rant about the historic banishment of the House of Stuart for its encouragement of Popery and arbitrary power, with the obvious implication for the future of the King himself, given the Relief Act he had sanctioned. Unsurprisingly, Gordon was denied access to the royal presence a third time.<br> &nbsp;<br> As all this demonstrates, as well as the charm and the compassion, there was something deeply erratic in Gordon&#x2019;s nature. On the one hand, it enabled him to exercise a hypnotic influence over large numbers of people. On the other hand, it could take an extremely aggressive form which brought its own consequences. Horace Walpole&#x2019;s lunatic apostle was on another occasion described by him as Lord George Macbeth. There was a saying that there were three parties in Parliament, the ministry, the Opposition and Lord George Gordon &#x2013; to which the man himself characteristically responded that he belonged to a fourth party, the party of the people. Another reference was made to the &#x2018;whirligig&#x2019; nature of his political speeches, which contrasted with the &#x2018;elegant young gentleman of engaging manners&#x2019; who went out in Society.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the Catholic Relief Bill was originally introduced into the House of Commons on 15 May 1778, not many Members were present and interest in it was lacklustre. It was not long, however, before stories began to spread and play upon the sus�ceptibilities of what seemed like a self-perpetuating Anti-Catholic mob. In Scotland a separate bill was proposed in 1779, but met with organized hostility in which Gordon took a keen personal interest. As a result, he was elected leader of the Scottish Protestant Association.<br> &nbsp;<br> One anecdote seems to sum up that mixture of good man�ners and ardent Anti-Popery which characterized Edinburgh.

Her new book, <i>We've Got Issues: Children and Parents in the Age of Medication</i>, will generate the same kind of controversy, as she tackles a subject that's just as contentious and important: Are parents and physicians too quick to prescribe medi�cation to control our children's behavior? Are we using drugs to excuse inept parents who can't raise their children properly? <br><br> What Warner discovered from the extensive research and interviewing she did for this book is that passion on both sides of the issue "is ideological and only tangentially about real children," and she cuts through the jargon and hysteria to delve into a topic that for millions of parents involves one of the most important decisions they'll ever make for their child. <br><br> Insightful, compelling, and deeply mov�ing, <i>We've Got Issues</i> is for parents, doctors, and teachers-anyone who cares about the welfare of today's children.</p><p>Judith Warner is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety</i> and <i>Hillary Clinton: The Inside Story</i>, as well as several other books. She writes the Domestic Disturbances column for the <i>New York Times</i> website and is a former special correspondent for <i>Newsweek</i> in Paris. She lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband and their children.In this manifesto for change, <i>New York Times</i> blogger Warner (<i>Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety</i>, 2005, etc.) examines the argument that Americans are overmedicating their children.<br> The author wanted to write a condemnation of American parents for hysterically spotting mental disorders where there are none. When she began interviewing parents and mental-health professionals, however, she reversed her position. Only five percent of American children take psychotropic drugs, she writes, yet that many suffer from extreme mental illness, while another 15 percent endure at least minimal illness. Not only has Warner never met a parent who lunged for the medicine cabinet to dope up their kids, but some fought the medication route as long as they could, to the detriment of their child. It's true that antidepressant prescriptions for children have skyrocketed, but that's because primitive understanding of the brain left many sick children undiagnosed in the past; we now have more effective drugs for some illnesses; and the stigma of mental illness is blessedly diminished. Warner cites research that girls, minority children and those with less-educated parents are undertreated for ADHD. Careful reporter that she is, the author acknowledges that some experts might dispute parts of her thesis. Other signs of childhood trauma-teen pregnancy, school violence, crime, substance abuse and suicide-have declined, and Warner reports special professional skepticism about exploding rates of bipolar diagnoses in children. Meanwhile, too many laypeople are spooked by drug companies' ads plugging their latest products, which doctors might not recommend. Curtailing those ads and more insurance coverage for pediatric mental-health screenings are among the author's welcome common-sense proposals.<br> Parents of mentally ill children will find this tonic reassuring, while all parents will find it a valuable reminder that it's not poor parenting to seek medical help for your children. <br> -<i>Kirkus</i> <br><br> "Warner, <i>New York Times</i> columnist and author of the best-selling <i>Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety</i>, set out to write a follow-up volume exposing what she believed were capricious diagnoses and medication of children's mental and learning disorders. Instead, she fell down the rabbit hole to an alternative reality. Although she found the stereotype of pushy parents who shop for prescriptions or educational accommodations to fit their overscheduled children, Warner's heartbreaking conversations with pediatricians and the parents of children with mental issues such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, serious depression, or bipolar disorders led her to see beyond her prejudices. As Warner passionately writes, appropriate care for childhood mental illness, if possible, is not necessarily probable. The perceived stigma of mental illness, deep-rooted suspicions of the medical and educational establishments, and, above all, merciless economic factors deny a shocking number of children with learning or mental disabilities the care and medications they need to succeed in school and society. Parents, social workers, and educators will find Warner's compelling study troubling but enlightening. Highly recommended. <br> -<i>Library Journal</i> <br><br> "This is a groundbreaking, thoughtfully argued book. My experience with families in the consulting room supports Judith Warner's nuanced argument exactly. The myth perpetrated by a breathless news media is fals: In reality, parents <i>don't</i> want to medicate their children. And every one of us has family members and friends (or ourselves!) who could have led richer, less anguished lives had they been given appropriate medication during childhood for learning or emotional problems." <br> -Wendy Mogel, Ph.D., author of <i>The Blessing of a Skinned Knee</i> <br><br> "This is an important book, a landmark book, a triumph of honesty over bigotry and of patient learning over the the rush to judgement. I see every day in my office the awful, preventable damage done by zealots and reductionistic 'thinking'. Judith Warner rejects the panicky sound-bites that have plagued the discussion of children's mental health for the complexity of truth. She brings to all who read her book the resoundingly good and hopeful news of how much we have learned over the past few decades, how trasforming the best help can be, and how all children can turn into responsible, joyful adults. We owe her a huge debt." <br> -Edward Hallowell, M.D., co-author of <i>Super Parenting for ADD</i> and author of <i>The Childhood Roots of Adult Happiness</i> <br><br> "Readers love Judith Warner because she is open, honest, attuned, and curious. In <i>We've Got Issues</i>, Warner considers children and psychotherapeutic medicine: whether drug companies hold too much sway, whether doctors over-prescribe, but also whether troubled boys and girls might sometimes need more help than they get today. The result is a caring and informed book that will earn the trust and loyalty of a wide audience." <br> -Peter D.

She considers herself lucky to be a mother of five and married to the love of her life.&nbsp;www.brendanovak.com <br><i>Sacramento, California </i><p><i>The present... </i></p><p>When Jasmine Stratford opened the package, she was standing in the middle of a crowded mall. Suddenly she couldn't hear a single sound. The laughing, the talking, the click-clack of shoes on the colorful floor, the Christmas music that'd been playing in the background&#x2014;it all disappeared as her ears began to ring. </p><p>"What is it?" Sheridan Kohl touched her arm, eyebrows gathered in concern. </p><p>The words came to Jasmine as if from a great distance, but she couldn't speak. Her lungs worked frantically, but her chest felt so tight she couldn't expand her diaphragm. Sweat trickled down her spine, causing her crisp cotton blouse to stick to her as she stared at the silver-and-pink bracelet she'd just pulled from the small cardboard box. </p><p>"What is it, Jaz?" Still frowning, her friend took the bracelet from Jasmine's cold fingers. As she read the name spelled out in silver letters separated by pink beads, her eyes filled with tears. "Oh, God!" she murmured, pressing a hand to her chest. </p><p>Jasmine's head spun. Afraid she might pass out, she reached for Sheridan, who helped her to the center of the mall and asked a man sitting in one of the few seats to move. </p><p>He collected the shopping bags piled at his feet and jumped up, allowing Jasmine to sink onto the hard plastic chair. </p><p>"Hey, she no looking good, eh? She sick or somet'ing?" he asked. </p><p>"She's just suffered a terrible shock," Sheridan explained. </p><p>The words floated over Jasmine as if they'd been written in the air, each letter flying past her, meaningless. Her nervous system seemed to be shutting down. Overload. Rejection of current input. Inability to cope. </p><p>"Don't move," Sheridan barked and put the bracelet back in the box on her lap. "I'll get you something to drink." </p><p>Jasmine couldn't have moved even if she wanted to. Her rubbery legs refused to support her weight, or she would've walked out of the mall. People were beginning to stare. </p><p>"What's wrong?" someone murmured, pausing near the Mexican man who was still watching her curiously. </p><p>"I don't know, but she no look good, eh?" he repeated. </p><p>A teenage boy ventured closer. "Are you okay, lady?" </p><p>"Maybe someone should call the paramedics," a woman said. </p><p><i>Wave them away. </i>But Jasmine's thoughts were so focused on what was in her lap, she couldn't even raise her hand. She'd made that bracelet as a gift for her little sister. She remembered Kimberly's delight when she'd unwrapped it on her eighth birthday, her last birthday before the tall man with the beard entered their house in Cleveland one sunny afternoon and took her away. </p><p>Jasmine's mind veered from the memories. Until she was twelve, she'd led such a safe and happy life she'd never dreamed she would encounter a threat in her own home. Strangers were people outside on the street. This man had acted like one of her father's workers, whose faces changed so often she wasn't familiar with them all. They were always coming to the house to pick up equipment for his satellite TV business, to get a check, to drop off some paperwork. Occasionally he hired vagrants to organize his warehouse or build a fence or even clean up the yard. In any event, she'd believed their visitor was a nice guy. </p><p>Heaven help her, she'd believed he was <i>nice. </i>And she'd let it happen.... </p><p>"You want I should call an ambulance?" the Mexican man ventured. </p><p>Jasmine had to cover her mouth so the screams inside her didn't escape. <i>Breathe deeply. Get hold of yourself. </i>After nearly destroying each other with their bitterness and grief, her parents had given up hope. But she'd kept a candle burning deep inside. And now this... </p><p>Sheridan returned and nudged her way through the four or five people who were watching to see if Jasmine would rally. "I've got her. Everything's fine," she told them, and they began to drift off, but not without a backward glance. "Drink this," she said. </p><p>The freshly squeezed lemonade tasted reassuringly normal. </p><p>A man seated next to them stood and offered Sheridan his chair. She thanked him and perched on the edge of it. </p><p>After a few minutes, Jasmine's breathing and heart rate slowed. Still, she was damp with sweat and when she tried to talk tears slipped down her cheeks. </p><p>"It's okay." Putting an arm around her, Sheridan squeezed her shoulders. "Take all the time you need." </p><p>Jasmine appreciated her friend's empathy, but now that the shock was wearing off she had so many questions. <i>Who had sent the bracelet? </i>Why after so long? What'd happened to her sister? And the biggest question of all&#x2014;was there <i>any </i>chance that Kimberly was still alive? </p><p>"I'm so sorry I brought that package with me, that you had to deal with this in a public setting." Sheridan's expression revealed her chagrin. "When I saw it sitting on the reception desk with the rest of the mail, I thought it might be something you've been waiting for. I knew you weren't planning on coming into the office today so I was..." she shrugged helplessly "...trying to be helpful." </p><p>Jasmine wiped her eyes. "It's okay. Of course you'd never expect anything like this." </p><p>"Who sent it?" </p><p>"I don't know." She studied the box. There was no return address. There wasn't even a note, just some crumpled packaging material&#x2014; </p><p>Jasmine's pulse spiked. <i>Wait a minute... </i>There was something written on one of the papers that'd been wadded up. </p><p>Careful not to tear the note or get her fingerprints all over it, she flattened it out&#x2014;and saw two words printed in what appeared to be blood: <i>Stop me. </i></p><p>That night, Jasmine hovered over the phone. Should she tell her parents about the bracelet? She couldn't decide. According to the cancellation stamp, the package had been sent from New Orleans, but she didn't know if she'd ever be able to glean more information than that. She was reluctant to open old wounds&#x2014;and yet, her folks had a right to the information, didn't they? Would they <i>want </i>to know? </p><p>She picked up the handset. Her father would. After the bearded man took Kimberly, Peter Stratford had become so single-minded in his quest to find his youngest daughter that he'd eventually lost everything&#x2014;his business, his wife, his home. He'd searched until he'd nearly driven himself mad. Searched until everyone else in his life, including Jasmine, had become nothing more than shadows. Even then he'd given up only because he had no choice. There was nowhere else to go, nothing more he could do. </p><p>Now that Peter had moved on, he was doing better than he had in years. Would learning about Kimberly's bracelet send him into another tailspin? </p><p>Jasmine set the phone down again. It probably wasn't wise to take the chance. </p><p>And then there was her East Indian mother. Gauri was so full of bitterness and blame, toward Peter <i>and </i>Jasmine, she had difficulty being in the same room with either of them. </p><p>The phone rang. Nervous that it might be one of her parents&#x2014;that she'd be confronted with a situation she hadn't figured out how to handle&#x2014;she checked caller ID, then breathed a sigh of relief. It was her friend and coworker, Skye Kellerman. Actually, Skye Willis since her marriage last year. </p><p>Dropping into a seat at the kitchen table, Jasmine rubbed her fingers over her left eyebrow as she answered. "Hello?" </p><p>"I just got your message. And several from Sheridan, too." Skye's voice came across as brisk, worried. "I'm sorry it took me a few hours to get back to you. David and I were in Tahoe and didn't have phone reception." </p><p>"It's fine," Jasmine said. </p><p>"It's not fine. Are you okay?" </p><p>Jasmine wasn't sure. One minute she was filled with rekindled hope, the next terrified that nothing could change the outcome of her sister's abduction. "I'm okay," she said, although her mind added a little "not." </p><p>"This is so...unexpected," Skye exclaimed. "Why now? Why after so many years?" </p><p>Jasmine had asked herself the same question. But it hadn't taken long to come up with the most probable answer. "It must be because of the publicity on the Polinaro case." Four weeks ago, she'd been on <i>America's Most Wanted, </i>profiling a sex offender who'd victimized nine boys. When authorities got too close, he fled. She'd been invited on the show to suggest places he might have gone, things he might be doing. </p><p>"Of course," Skye agreed. "That episode aired right before Thanksgiving." </p><p>"How else would he have known where to find me?" After her mother had remarried and left Cleveland, where Jasmine was born, Jasmine had dropped out of high school and moved away from home, starting a three-year descent into drug abuse and self-destruction. During that time, she'd drifted from one city to another, working odd jobs, even begging in the streets for enough money for one more fix. She doubted anyone could've tracked her movements back then. Her parents certainly hadn't been aware, much of the time, of where she was or what she was doing. It wasn't until Harvey Nolasco, a long-distance trucker, picked her up and insisted she get some help that she settled down.

Gilbert Meilaender maintains that this frustrated desire lies at the heart of our existence. In <i>The Way That Leads There</i> he takes Augustine as a "conversation partner" for exploring subjects that human beings have wrestled with for centuries -- desire, duty, politics, sex, and grief. Meilaender's carefully reasoned, insightful work rescues Augustine from many of our misperceptions and interacts meaningfully with both C. S. Lewis and Catholic moral theology, generating insights on difficult topics. The picture of life that emerges in these pages is one of incompleteness, of our inability to perfect and unify our moral lives. Yet this inability is not a cause for despair; it is rather a call to look, with Augustine, to God as the source and object of our greatest desire.</p><p>Gilbert Meilaender is Phyllis and Richard DuesenbergProfessor of Christian Ethics at Valparaiso University inIndiana and a member of the President&#39;s Council onBioethics. His many other books include Faith andFaithfulness: Basic Themes in Christian Ethics;Body, Soul, and Bioethics; and Things That Count:Essays Moral and Theological.<b>Lilly Fellows Program in the Humanities and the Arts</b>,&nbsp;<i>Arlin G. Meyer Prize</i>&nbsp;(2007)<br><br><b>Robert Louis Wilken</b><br> &#x2014; University of Virginia<br> "There is no Christian thinker writing in English today that I enjoy reading more than Gilbert Meilaender, and this new book is no exception. In the company of St. Augustine he ponders what it means to live a mature Christian life. The charm is found not only in Meilaender's wisdom (winnowed by experience) but also in his inventive selection of passages from Augustine (often unnoticed by others) and in the leisurely pace of his prose. Nothing is hurried as Meilaender patiently teases out the issues without rushing to conclusions. This is a book that invites reflection."<br><br><b>William Werpehowski</b><br> &#x2014; Villanova University<br> "A splendid account of the shape of Christian identity and the Christian moral life. With characteristic wisdom and insight, Gilbert Meilaender develops the continuities and tensions present in our loves for God and neighbor, as they are made manifest in political life, sexual bonds, and the experience of grief. One of our finest Christian ethicists has written his finest book to date."<br><br><b><i>Expository Times</i></b><br> "This book will be of help to those really seeking to understand what it is to be fully human."<br><br><b><i>Catholic Book Review</i></b><br> "A series of reflections on Christian living that are uniquely Meilander. . . [<i>The Way That Leads There</i>] gets to the guts of morality. A good read, a good way to keep anchored in the midst of . . . the great ethical debates of the day."<br><br><b><i>Commonweal</i></b><br> "For all their rigor and perspicuity, [Meilaender's] books are always animated by a careful love. They take part in the 'struggle to distinguish,' but ultimately all their distinctions are for the sake of leading us to Jesus."<br><br><b><i>America</i></b><br> "Meilaender writes with clarity and verve, respectful of the historical distance between Augustine and us, yet refusing to let that distance separate us from Augustine's wisdom. He has truly provided a rich banquet."<br><br><b><i>Interpretation</i></b><br> "A gracefully written book. . . It is likely to have greatest value for pastors, and for thoughtful Christians generally, who are looking for some genuine guidance in moral reflection."</p><h2>The Greatest Beer Run Ever: A True Story of Friendship Stronger Than War</h2><p><p>In 1967, John (Chick) Donohue was a 26-year-old U.S. Marine Corps veteran working as a merchant seaman when he was challenged one night in a New York City bar. The men gathered at this hearth had lost family and friends in the ongoing war in Vietnam. Now, they were seeing protesters turn on the troops. One neighborhood patriot proposed an idea many might deem preposterous: One of them should sneak into Vietnam, track down their buddies in combat, and give each of them messages of support from back home, maybe some laughs - and beer. </p><p>Chick volunteered for the mission. He sailed to Vietnam on a cargo ship carrying a backpack full of American beer, landing in Qui Nho'n in 1968.

Fresh out of divinity school and full of enthusiasm, Lischer found himself assigned to a small conservative church in an economically depressed town in southern Illinois. This was far from what this overly enthusiastic and optimistic young man expected. The town was bleak, poor, and clearly <i>not</i> a step on his path to a brilliant career.<br><br>It's an awkward marriage at best, a young man with a Ph.D. in theology, full of ideas and ambitions, determined to improve his parish and bring them into the twenty-first century, and a community that is "as tightly sealed as a jar of home-canned pickles." In their own way, they welcome him and his family, even though they think he's "got bigger fish to fry." Thus begins Richard Lischer's first year as a pastor: bringing communion to the sick (but forgetting to bring the wafers); marrying two unlikely couples--a pregnant teenager and her boyfriend, and two people who can't stop fighting.<br><br>Often he doesn't understand his congregation, and sometimes they don't understand him; for instance, why does his wife hire a baby-sitter and instead of leaving, put on her bathing suit, grab a stack of novels, and hide from the kids? Or why can't Pastor Lischer see how important it is for a woman with little money to buy an elaborate coffin to bury her husband in? <br><br>There are also the moments of grace, when pastor and parishioner unite for a common goal: when he asks for prayers for his infant son, and can feel everyone in the congregation ministering to him; when old hurts are put aside to help a desperate young woman finish college and raise her baby; or when he helps save a woman from dying of a drug overdose.<br><br>In <b>Open Secrets </b>Lischer tells not only his own story but also the story of New Cana and all of its inhabitants--lovable, deeply flawed, imperfect people that stick together. With his sharp eye and keen wit, Lischer perfectly captures the comedy of small town life with all of its feuds, rumors, scandals, and friendships. In the end he learns to appreciate not only the life New Cana has to offer, but also the people who have accepted him, at last, as part of themselves.</p><p>At the age of 28, Richard Lischer, a smart, ambitious Lutheran pastor with a freshly minted Ph.D. in theology, was sent to his first parish, in the small town of New Cana, Illinois, where he would serve for almost three years. <i>Open Secrets</i> is Lischer's memoir of that time, and it opens with a sharply detailed evocation of New Cana as he first saw it: <blockquote>It lacked the traditional accessories that make a town picturesque--no courthouse, town square, or ivy-covered cottages. The few white picket fences I saw were in disrepair and were obviously placed to keep the chickens in the yard ... Nothing was awakened in me when I saw the place for the first time. No Grovers Corners in <i>Our Town</i> or folksy Mayberry beckoned to me. My first look at the town reminded me that I was from a city and probably belonged in a city.</blockquote> As this passage indicates, <i>Open Secrets</i> demystifies the often-idealized experience of small-town ministry. Lischer (now a professor at Duke University's divinity school) was often disappointed by his parish, and by his own resentment of his calling: the town never quite warmed to him, and he never quite cottoned to the town. But he did pay close attention to everything he experienced, and his anecdotes (what happens when, taking communion to a sick man, you forget to bring the Host to the hospital?) and observations (75 percent of his congregation had the same last name) are occasionally reminiscent of Garrison Keillor's stories of Lake Wobegone, or J.F. Powers's more astringent comedies of priestly life. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"Out of the unlikeliest material, Richard Lischer has produced a genuinely <i>exciting</i> book. Again and again I was amused, enlivened, nourished, and deeply moved by the truth of the tale he tells with such authenticity and wit."<br>--Frederick Buechner, author of <b>The Sacred Journey</b>, <b>The Hungry Dark</b>, and <b>The Eyes of the Heart<br><br></b>"Beautifully written, <b>Open Secrets</b><i> </i>is a personal story that draws readers more deeply into the abiding human story. Gentle, humorous, and poignant by turns, Lischer is an excellent storyteller who helps us see the drama of faith that so often unfolds in undramatic settings. In the faces and foibles of the people in this book, we glimpse the extraordinary gift of Christian community taking shape in the ordinary times and places of life."<br>--Craig Koester, Professor at Lutheran North Western Seminary<br>"Richard Lischer's memoir of the early years of his ministry is beautifully candid, funny, merciful, and surprising. With a novelist's sense of the shape of a good scene and the power of true dialogue, he builds a compelling picture of widely different human beings in spiritual crisis and in dull daily life. I learned a lot." <br>--Reynolds Price<br><br>"The ministry used to be called 'The Cure of the Souls,' and that is what comes to mind in this candid, compassionate, and at times quite funny account of a young pastor's first church. Part Garrison Keillor and part Reinhold Niebuhr, this memoir of innocence and experience is destined for classic status."<br>--Rev. Peter J. Gomes, Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, Harvard University, and author of <b>The Good Book<br></b><br>"There may be secrets in this book, but there are no lies. With his clear eye and deft touch, Lischer tells the truth about everyday life on earth: how love is hardest among those who are bound together by it, how faith in God offers no protection from loss, and how ordinary people regularly save each other's lives by their simple willingness to be human. In this memoir that reads more like a novel, Lischer gives us reason to hope in the transforming power of a community that survives not by virtue but by grace." <br>--Dr. Barbara Brown Taylor, Professor of Religion at Piedmont College, author of <b>When God Is Silent</b><i><br></i><br>"It might seem trite to call <b>Open Secrets </b>true, but that is its rare and sparkling virtue. The book's honesty about ministry and mistakes, parables and the presence of God is also provocative and moving. Along the fields of this country church narrative, Lischer's humble storytelling plants in us seeds of wisdom that will grow in prayer, passion, good gossip, the 'real presence,' healthy tradition, sound community, genuine authority, rebuke and reconciliation, grace, healing, faithful pastoral care, and the glory of God. Give this book to everyone you know! Its characters are recognizable in our own lives, and the accounts will profoundly change us."<br>--Dr. Marva J. Dawn, Professor of Spiritual Theology, Regent College, Vancouver<br><br>"Richard Lischer's <b>Open Secrets</b><i> </i>is an inspired use of humor, observation of small town life in rural Illinois, and subtle theologizing about the 'miracle of community.' He tells the story of his first parish--a conservative Lutheran enclave--with honesty and empathy, exposing the ambitions and pretensions of its twenty-eight-year-old pastor, who is gradually educated by his unprepossessing congregation. <b>Open Secrets</b><i> </i>is as funny as the best of Garrison Keillor, but goes deeper because it is more self-critical."<br>--Sally Cunneen, author of <b>In Search of Mary</b> and cofounder, <i>Cross Currents<br></i></p><h2>And Jesus Said...

How are guest lists and seating charts for state dinners determined? Is it difficult to throw a surprise party for the commander-in-chief? What role do children play during holidays at the White House? Former first lady Nancy Reagan answers these questions and more as she provides a personal look at life as a White House hostess in this stunning, richly illustrated book.</p><p>Carrying on a tradition that dates back to 1801, Mrs. Reagan embraced this role with a unique energy and joie de vivre rare among her predecessors. During the course of President Reagan's two terms in office, the Reagans hosted fifty-five state dinners and hundreds of other events, both intimate and grand. "It was a vital part of our roles as president and first lady," recalls Mrs. Reagan. "And it was a duty that we enjoyed immensely."</p><p>From her first private event as a White House hostess (President Reagan's surprise seventieth birthday party, which was mistakenly announced by Tom Brokaw on the <em>Today</em> show that very morning), to the state dinner with Mikhail Gorbachev that marked the unofficial end of the Cold War, to John Travolta's surprise dance with Diana, Princess of Wales, Mrs. Reagan has seen it all. </p></p><p><p>Peter Schifando and J. Jonathan Joseph are internationally known interior designers and have been friends of Mrs. Reagan's for more than twenty years. Schifando worked with designer Ted Graber, who restored the living quarters of the White House. When Graber retired, Mrs. Reagan retained Schifando as her designer. Joseph is a member of the American Society of Interior Designers and former president of the organization's New England chapter. He assisted Schifando in the interior design of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley and is a partner in the Peter Schifando Company. The authors live in Los Angeles, California.</p>Schifando and Joseph sweep readers into the elegant world of Washington elite in this photo-heavy look at White House entertaining, particularly during the presidency of Ronald Regan. The authors begin with a look at various presidential approaches to entertaining and the emergence of a uniquely American style. The greater part of the volume is devoted to the intricate details in meal preparation, table setting, protocol and etiquette in the private gatherings and celebrations of the Regan administration; former first lady Nancy Regan shares her scrapbooks and journals with the same hospitality she showed visiting dignitaries. Though it steers clear of politics, Schifando and Joseph never stray from one of the books' central themes, the importance of White House entertaining in American statesmanship, not just a ceremonial procedure but a chance for real change in international relations, simply by virtue of formal proximity and the unexpected connections it can engender: "In the East Room of the White House, surrounded by Cold War hawks like Jeane Kirkpatrick and Dick Cheney, the leaders of the Communist Party were serenading the guests." Party-goers and party-throwers alike will enjoy this full-color behind-the-scenes look at the People's house, featuring hundreds of photos that take readers from world-famous celebrations to casual private dinners. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After persuading the Chief Commissioner to allow him to set up a clandestine team to deal with such situations, Beech puts together a small motley crew of well-educated women and professional policemen.&nbsp; As Beech, Victoria, Caroline, Rigsby and Tollman investigate the murder, they delve into the seedier parts of WWI London, taking them from criminal gangs to brothels and underground drug rings supplying heroin to the upper classes. Will the Mayfair 100 team solve the murder? And if they do, will they be allowed to continue working as a team? Perfect for fans of Foyle's War and The Bletchley Circle.

Her debut book, Celtic Folk-Soul, illuminates the beauty, power and spirit of nature expressed through the ancient language of Celtic art and symbol: the voice of the Folk-Soul. This beautiful book is rich with Delyth&#39;s stunning artwork and is structured around a symbolic nine-chapter motif. From Roots/Elements to Stone/Mysteries to Beyond the Ninth Wave, Delyth pairs insightful explanations with her radiant artwork, Celtic myth and poetry revealing to us background, meaning and depth to the theme of each section. Celtic Folk-Soul takes us on a journey of discovery into the many aspects of Celtic myth and symbolism. This is an ancient thread which weaves back through the art, myth and poetry and connects us to a complex mysticism that expresses the interconnection and balance of all things. The book includes a foreword by Robin Williamson.</p><p>Artist Jen Delyth creates original Celtic paintings and illustrations which explore the language of myth and symbol inspired by Celtic folklore and the spirit within nature. Her work is inspired by the folk motifs and symbols of the ancient Celts, but woven through her experience and vision as a woman of the twenty-first century. Born and raised in south Wales, Jen Delyth was surrounded by the kind of landscapes that have inspired poets and artists throughout the ages. This early connection to the natural world has played an integral role in her development as an artist. Drawing from ancient metaphors and integrating the visual motifs and language of Celtic patterning into original new designs, Jen Delyth finds the symmetry of form and symbol that expresses living archetypes. Her work is stylistically contemporary, iconographic, reflecting spiritual and philosophical roots which embody universal themes that reflect her love of nature and Celtic symbolism.Jen Delyth has created a stunning book that captures the essence of Celtic magic and Druid Mysteries. On every page her evocative images, modeled on the early Celts yet carrying her own unique imprint, draw you into the depth and richness of a Cauldron of Enchantment. Stories and poems, legend and lore, create a feast for the eye and food for the soul! --Mara Freeman, author of 'Kindling the Celtic Spirit: Ancient Traditions to Illumine your Life through the Season'<br><br>A rich, wide ranging book with something for every reader drawn to the Celtic world.

He gained enormous popular and critical acclaim for both his mainstream and his science fiction novels. Iain Banks died in June 2013.Banks has woven a warm and funny story, rich with characters and adventures. An utterly enchanting piece of fiction...it marks a return to his brilliant best. NEW WOMAN This is Bank s&#39; finest novel yet. INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY Hip and sexy humour...Bank reinforces his credentials as one of the most able, energetic and stimulating writers we have in the UK. TIME OUT The Crow Road is tight with detail and closer observation and creates a strong sense of a particular period of growing up. THE INDEPENDENT Magic is the book&#39;s keynote. It echoes in descriptions of evolution that pass from the factual to the elegiac and on the mythical. It calls most insistently when intensity - of love, lust or grief - burst through limited expectations or circumstances to release poetry. THE TIMES Banks keeps death in its place, under the boot of wit which knows that the most significant romance can blossom whilst your youngest brother is up to the elbow in Sugar Smacks looking for the plastic toy. OBSERVER The tense horror of the book...is done with considerable imaginative subtlety and a fine touch...This is as fine and ambitious a novel as any from a Scottish writer since the 1960s. It is also unquestionable Bank&#39;s best work to date. NEW STATESMAN A magnificent, rambling family saga...his best novel yet.

Checking jacket copy for howlers, wondering how to break it to her star novelist that her latest effort is utterly unpublishable, lunch scheduled with gossipy author Kit Lowell, whose new book will dish the juicy dirt on a recent fashion industry scandal. Little does she know the trouble Kit's book will cause-before it even goes to print. When police Inspector Field turns up at the venerable offices of Timmins &amp; Ross, asking questions about a package addressed to Sam, she knows something is wrong. Now Sam's nine-to-five life is turned upside down as she finds herself propelled into a criminal investigation. Someone doesn't want Kit's manuscript published and unless Sam can put the pieces together in time, they'll do anything to stop it.</p><p>With this deliciously funny debut novel, acclaimed author Judith Flanders introduces readers to an enormously enjoyable, too-clever-for-her-own-good new amateur sleuth, as well Sam's Goth assistant, her effortlessly glamorous mother, and the handsome Inspector Field.

Agent Al Dewey, of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, has a crime to solve. A horrific crime - the cool slaughter of an entire family of God-fearing farming folk. Blood and hair all over the walls, and only a few dollars missing. All Agent Dewey has are two footprints, four dead bodies and a whole lots of questions, none with easy answers. Truman Capote&#39;s brilliant reconstruction of the events and consequences of the murderous November night in 1959 is a superb and gripping mix of journalistic skill and sheer imaginative power.</p><p><i>In Cold Blood</i> was a groundbreaking work when released in 1966. With it, author Truman Capote contributed to a style of writing in which the reporter gets so far inside the subject, becomes so familiar, that he projects events and conversations as if he were really there. The style has probably never been accomplished better than in this book. Capote combined painstaking research with a narrative feel to produce one of the most spellbinding stories ever put on the page. Two two-time losers living in a lonely house in western Kansas are out to make the heist of their life, but when things don't go as planned, the robbery turns ugly. From there, the book is a real-life look into murder, prison, and the criminal mind.On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. <br>Five years, four months and twenty-nine days later, on April 14, 1965, Richard Eugene Hickock, aged thirty-three, and Perry Edward Smith, aged thirty-six, were hanged from the crime on a gallows in a warehouse in the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, Kansa. <br>In Cold Blood is the story of the lives and deaths of these six people. It has already been hailed as a masterpiece.</p><h2>Qr: The Quieting Reflex</h2><p>Describes tension-related illnesses and a new self-regulation technique designed to relieve stress</p><p></p><h2>The Manly Handbook</h2><p>Tongue in cheek advice about how to act like a man is accompanied by examples of virile and effeminate behavior</p><p></p><h2>Footsteps: Adventures of a Romantic Biographer</h2><p>Richard Holmes&#39;s great work of biographical exploration, rejacketed and republished alongside its sister volume &#39;Sidetracks&#39;. In 1985, Richard Holmes published a small book of essays called &#39;Footsteps&#39; and the writing of biography was changed forever. A daring mix of travel, biographical sleuthing and personal memoir, it broke all the conventions of the genre and remains ons of the most intoxicating, magical works of modern literary exploration ever published. Sleeping rough, he retraces Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s famous journey through the Cevennes. Caught up in the Parisian riots of the 1960s, he dives back in time to the terrors of Wordsworth and of Mary Wollstonecraft marooned in Revolutionary Paris and then into the strange tortured worlds of Gerard de Nerval. Wandering through Italy, he stalks Shelley and his band of Romantic idealists to Casa Magni on the Gulf of Spezia.</p><p>Richard Holmes knew he had become a true biographer the day his bank bounced a check that he had inadvertently dated 1772. Because for the acclaimed chronicler of Shelly and Coleridge, biography is a physical pursuit, an ardent and arduous retracing of footsteps that may have vanished centuries before. In this gripping book, Holmes takes us from France&#39;s Massif Central, where he followed the route taken by Robert Louis Stevenson and a sweet-natured donkey, to Mary Wollstonecraft&#39;s Revolutionary Paris, to the Italian villages where Percy Shelly tried to cast off the structures of English morality and marriage. Footsteps is a wonderful exploration of the ties between biographers and their subjects, filled with passion and revelation.<b>Richard Holmes</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Age of Wonder</i>,&nbsp;which was short-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction, won the Royal Society Prize for Science Books and the National Books Critics Circle Award, and was one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>'s Best Books of the Year in 2009.

The Uncomfortable Nearness of Strangers</b><br><br> September 1&#x2014;afternoon <br><br> Dear Isabel, <br><br> As a member of the family, you have a right to know what&#x2019;s going on. Dad agrees but says I should avoid &#x201c;topics of substance and despair.&#x201d; When I asked how he propose I do this, seeing as our family is prone to substantial desperation, he rolled his eyes and flared his nostrils, like he does. The thing is, I'm incapable of fluff, so here goes. The straight dope, Mim-style. Filled to the brim with &#x201c;topics of substance and despair.&#x201d; <br><br> Just over a month ago, I moved from the greener pastures of Ashland, Ohio, to the dried-up wastelands of Jackson, Mississippi, with Dad and Kathy. During that time, it's possible I&#x2019;ve gotten into some trouble at my new school. Not trouble with a capital T, you understand, but this is a subtle distinction for adults once they&#x2019;re determined to ruin a kid's youth. My new principal is just such a man. He scheduled a conference for ten a.m. this morning, in which the malfeasance of Mim Malone would be the only point of order. Kathy switched her day shift at Denny's so she could join Dad as a parental representative. I was in algebra II, watching Mr. Harrow carry on a romantic relationship with his polynomials, when my name echoed down the coral-painted hallways. <br><br> &#x201c;Mim Malone, please report to Principal Schwartz's office. Mim Malone to the principal's office.&#x201d; <br><br> (Suffice it to say, I didn't want to go, but the Loudspeaker summoned, and the Student responded, and 'twas always thus.) <br><br> The foyer leading into the principal&#x2019;s office was dank, a suffocating decor of rusty maroons and browns. Inspirational posters were plastered around the room, boasting one-word encouragements and eagles soaring over purple mountains' majesty. <br><br> I threw up a little, swallowed it back down. <br><br> &#x201c;You can go on back,&#x201d; said a secretary without looking up. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re expecting you.&#x201d; <br><br> Beyond the secretary's desk, Principal Schwartz's heavy oak door was cracked open an inch. Nearing it, I heard low voices on the other side. <br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s her mother's name again?&#x201d; asked Schwartz, his timbre muffled by that lustrous seventies mustache, a holdover from the glory days no doubt. <br><br> &#x201c;Eve,&#x201d; said Dad. <br><br> Schwartz: &#x201c;Right, right. What a shame. Well, I hope Mim is grateful for your involvement, Kathy. Heaven knows she needs a mother figure right now.&#x201d; <br><br> Kathy: &#x201c;We all just want Eve to get better, you know? And she will. She&#x2019;ll beat this disease. Eve&#x2019;s a fighter.&#x201d; <br><br> Just outside the door, I stood frozen&#x2014;inside and out. <br><br> Disease? <br><br> Schwartz: (Sigh.) &#x201c;Does Mim know?&#x201d; <br><br> Dad: (Different kind of sigh.) &#x201c;No. The time just doesn't seem right. New school, new friends, lots of . . . new developments, as you can see.&#x201d; <br><br> Schwartz: (Chuckle.) &#x201c;Quite. Well, hopefully things will come together for Eve in . . . where did you say she was?&#x201d; <br><br> Dad: &#x201c;Cleveland. And thank you. We&#x2019;re hoping for the best.&#x201d; <br><br>(Every great character, Iz, be it on page or screen, is multidimensional. The good guys aren&#x2019;t all good, the bad guys aren&#x2019;t all bad, and any character wholly one or the other shouldn&#x2019;t exist at all. Remember this when I describe the antics that follow, for though I am not a villain, I am not immune to villainy.) <br><br> Our Heroine turns from the oak door, calmly exits the office, the school, the grounds. She walks in a daze, trying to put the pieces together. Across the football field, athletic meatheads sneer, but she hears them not. Her trusty Goodwill shoes carry her down the crumbling sidewalk while she considers the three-week drought of letters and phone calls from her mother. Our Heroine takes the shortcut behind the Taco Hole, ignoring its beefy bouquet. She walks the lonely streets of her new neighborhood, rounds the skyscraping oak, and pauses for a moment in the shade of her new residence. She checks the mailbox&#x2014;empty. As always. Pulling out her phone, she dials her mother's number for the hundredth time, hears the same robotic lady for the hundredth time, is disheartened for the hundredth time. <br><br> We're sorry, this number has been disconnected. <br><br> She shuts her phone and looks up at this new house, a house bought for the low, low price of Everything She'd Ever Known to Be True. &#x201c;Glass and concrete and stone,&#x201d; she whispers, the chorus of one of her favorite songs. She smiles, pulls her hair back into a ponytail, and finishes the lyric. &#x201c;It is just a house, not a home.&#x201d; <br><br> Bursting through the front door, Our Heroine takes the steps three at a time. She ignores the new-house smell&#x2014;a strange combination of sanitizer, tacos, and pigheaded denial&#x2014;and sprints to her bedroom. Here, she repacks her trusty JanSport backpack with overnight provisions, a bottle of water, toiletries, extra clothes, meds, war paint, makeup remover, and a bag of potato chips. She dashes into her father and stepmother&#x2019;s bedroom and drops to her knees in front of the feminine dresser. Our Heroine reaches behind a neatly folded stack of Spanx in the bottom drawer and retrieves a coffee can labeled HILLS BROS. ORIGINAL BLEND. Popping the cap, she removes a thick wad of bills and counts by Andrew Jacksons to eight hundred eighty dollars. (Her evil stepmother had overestimated the secrecy of this hiding spot, for Our Heroine sees all.) <br><br> Adding the can of cash to her backpack, she bolts from her house-not-a-home, jogs a half-mile to the bus stop, and catches a metro line to the Jackson Greyhound terminal. She&#x2019;d known the where for a while now: Cleveland, Ohio, 947 miles away. But until today, she wasn&#x2019;t sure of the how or when. <br><br> The how: a bus. The when: pronto, posthaste, lickety-split. And . . . scene.&nbsp; But you&#x2019;re a true Malone, and as such, this won&#x2019;t be enough.

In <b>The River at the Center of the World: A Journey Up the Yangtze and Back in Chinese Time</b>, he chronicles his adventures across China along the 3,964-mile River. Employing nearly every mode of transportation--including boat, train, jeep and shoe leather--Winchester recalls his passionate exploration of the countryside, while providing important and engaging historical information. His recollections of the Chinese people are often less complimentary, as he exudes an air of disgust at the country's apparent disregard for pollution, its awkward modern architecture and decaying historical monuments.It is the symbolic heart of China. Rising in the mountains of the Tibetan border, it pierces 3,900 miles of rugged country before debouching into the oily swells of the East China Sea. Its path embraces every geographic feature and almost every ethnic group, and its banks are home to both scenic splendor and foul industrial pollution. Connecting China&#39;s heartland cities with that volatile coastal giant Shanghai, it has also historically connected China to the outside world through its nearly one thousand miles of navigable waters. And to travel up those waters is to travel back in history, to sense the soul of China. Long off-limits to foreigners, the far reaches of the Yangtze are still off-limits to most tourists and travelers simply by dint of the difficulty in traversing the terrain. But, for Simon Winchester, traveling the length of this mighty river was a lifelong dream and, together with a Chinese companion, he set out to do just that. The result is this unforgettable portrait of China. Endlessly curious, urbane, witty, and knowledgeable, Winchester introduces us to a world we might otherwise have missed. To follow him on his adventures up the Yangtze is to experience the essence of China - to absorb its flavors as well as learn its history and politics, to feel its geography and climate as well as engage in its culture, and to meet up en route with uncommon people in remote and almost inaccessible places. This is travel writing at its best: lively and informative, amusing and thoroughly engaging.</p><h2>Bend-the-Rules Sewing: The Essential Guide to a Whole New Way to Sew</h2><p>Author Amy Karol, whose Angry Chicken is one of the best-loved craft blogs on the Web, brings stitchers everywhere a down-to-earth introduction to sewing, including thirty projects so adorable and cool they&#x2019;ll inspire anyone to pick up a needle and thread. <br><br>Written with Amy&#x2019;s characteristic warmth and flair, you&#x2019;ll find information on basic equipment and supplies, advice on choosing and using fabrics, and a fantastic section on techniques.

The tiger did not know that they were bombs...&#39; A tiger escapes from the local zoo, padding through the ruined streets and onwards, to a ridge above the Balkan village of Galina. His nocturnal visits hold the villagers in a terrified thrall. But for one boy, the tiger is a thing of magic - Shere Khan awoken from the pages of The Jungle Book. Natalia is the granddaughter of that boy. Now a doctor, she is visiting orphanages after another war has devastated the Balkans. On this journey, she receives word of her beloved grandfather&#39;s death, far from their home, in circumstances shrouded in mystery. From fragments of stories her grandfather told her as a child, Natalia realises he may have died searching for &#39;the deathless man&#39;, a vagabond who was said to be immortal. Struggling to understand why a man of science would undertake such a quest, she stumbles upon a clue that will lead her to a tattered copy of The Jungle Book, and then to the extraordinary story of the tiger&#39;s wife.</p><p><strong>Author One-on-One: Jennifer Egan and T�a Obreht</strong> <p><b>Jennifer Egan is the recipient of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel <em>A Visit from the Goon Squad</em>, which was also awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award. She is the author of <em>The Keep</em>, <em>Look at Me</em>, and the story collection <em>Emerald City</em>. Her stories have been published in <i>The New Yorker, Harper&#x2019;s Magazine, GQ, Zoetrope: All-Story</i>, and <i>Ploughshares</i>, and her nonfiction appears frequently in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>. She lives with her husband and sons in Brooklyn.</b></p> <p></p> <p><b>Jennifer Egan:</b> One of the central powerful relationships in the book is between Natalia and her grandfather: it&#x2019;s not the type of relationship we usually see as the primary relationship in a novel. Could you talk a little about that grandparent-grandchild relationship, your feelings about it in your own life and how it became central in this novel?</p> <p><b>T�a Obreht:</b> I grew up with my grandparents on my mother&#x2019;s side, and they essentially raised me. As a kid, you resist the idea of your own parents having had lives and pasts of their own. Snuff me out if I&#x2019;m wrong here, but I see that as something prevalent in your novel A Visit From the Goon Squad: a sense of the parent-child relationship being very tense and of children not wanting to live in their parents&#x2019; shadow. When you&#x2019;re growing up, the lives of your parents aren&#x2019;t that fascinating, but there is this fascination with grandparents. Because of that great amount of time that has passed between their youth and yours, and the fact that they lived entire lives before you even got there, you can&#x2019;t really deny their identity as individuals prior to your existence they way perhaps you can with your parents. There&#x2019;s also an awareness that the world was very different when they were living their lives.</p> <p><b>Egan:</b> Animals play such an enormous role in the novel: the tiger, the dog, Sonia the elephant, Darisa who seems to be part-human, part-bear. You write so movingly about animals that I found myself close to tears every time you wrote about the tiger from the tiger&#x2019;s point of view. Do you have a strong connection to animals in your life? How is it that animals end up figuring so enormously in this story?</p> <p><b>Obreht:</b> I&#x2019;m definitely, it turns out, the kind of person who&#x2019;s a total National Geographic nerd. I&#x2019;m there for all the TV specials. As I&#x2019;ve gotten older I think my awareness of the natural world and animals&#x2019; relationship to people--both culturally and biologically--has grown. It was fun to write from the point of view of the tiger, and emotionally rewarding, but I think the animals also serve almost as markers around which the characters have to navigate. I don&#x2019;t think that was something I did consciously, it just sort of happened. There is something jarring about seeing an animal out of place: there&#x2019;s a universal feeling of awe when you see an animal, particularly an impressive animal, out of place.</p> <p><b>Egan:</b> There are really two worlds in the book which mingle and sometimes intersect: there&#x2019;s the present day political, medical, scientific situation in which Natalia operates, and then there&#x2019;s this more mystical, folkloric world of the grandfather&#x2019;s past. How did these define themselves in your mind? Was it hard to move between them?</p> <p><b>Obreht:</b> Pretty early on in the writing I realized that mythmaking and storytelling are a way in which people deal with reality. They&#x2019;re a coping mechanism. In Balkan culture, there&#x2019;s almost a knowledge that reality will eventually become myth. In ten or twenty years you will be able to recount what happened today with more and more embellishments until you&#x2019;ve completely altered that reality and funneled it into the world of myth.</p> <p><strong>A Letter from the Author<br></strong></p> <p><strong>T�a Obreht </strong>was born in Belgrade in the former Yugoslavia in 1985 and has lived in the United States since the age of twelve.

T�a Obreht lives in New York.</p> <p></p> After completing my first novel, <em>The Tiger&#x2019;s Wife</em>, I&#x2019;ve found myself indulging in a sentimental mood. I pretend that this is due to my need to retrace my steps, to see how it all came together, and, by remembering what I did before, somehow speed my next project along; in fact, I am probably just procrastinating or being insufferable, mulling over memories that, due to the late hours, were doomed to an impregnable haze a long time ago. I dig through my &#x201c;notes&#x201d;: folded scraps of paper, the backs of torn-open envelopes where I doodled plot points and lines of dialogue, index cards with cryptic inscriptions&#x2014;&#x201c;BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WATERMELON?!?!?&#x201d;&#x2014;punctuated as though I&#x2019;d had some kind of civilization-saving breakthrough. <p></p> For whatever reason, as I go through my notes, I spend much of my time revisiting the evolution of my characters. &nbsp; Who&#x2019;s been there the longest? Who was thrown out at the last minute? Who was the life and soul of the first draft, and then ended up with one dialogue in the third? Who&#x2019;s been renamed, transformed completely into somebody else? <p></p> &gt;In some ways, the answers to these questions are both pointless and intensely personal, like telling a long-distance friend about how you&#x2019;ve fallen in love with a person they have never met: they can listen politely while you rattle off a list of traits or events, but a whole world of experience separates the storyteller from the listener. But I do believe that thinking about these things gets back to the vital question of artistic control, and the surprising ways in which your work takes on a life of its own. In <em>The Tiger&#x2019;s Wife</em>, I found, of course, that core of the cast members&#x2014; a tiger, his &#x201c;wife,&#x201d; a little boy&#x2014;were all together at the outset, in the spring of 2007, peopling a lackluster short story about a deaf-mute girl who arrives in a snowbound village in pursuit of the escaped tiger with whom she performed in a traveling circus. But, to my surprise, I also found a then-minor character called Dari&#x161;a the Bear. <p></p> Originally, he was a mean drunk, a ruthless and uncomplicated villain, hardened by religious fanaticism, and I wanted the reader&#x2019;s revulsion with him to be simple and complete. When the story began to expand, and the village of Galina and the characters who live there expanded with it, there was no room for Dari&#x161;a; his kind of villainy had been eclipsed by a far more sinister character, and he was extracted and put away. He wouldn&#x2019;t find his way into the book again until one afternoon, almost a year later, when I found myself at the Moscow flea market of Ismailova&#x2014;a townie-shunned tourist trap against which the few Russians I knew had cautioned me&#x2014;and among the predictable lacquered matrioshkas, bootleg DVDs, prints of Soviet propaganda and fake Faberg� baubles, I met the bear-man. I can&#x2019;t picture his face anymore, but I do remember that he had pitched his booth at the top of a wide, stone staircase, and that, draping down from the top like water, were the pelts of maybe two dozen brown bears of all shapes and shades, mouths agape. We must have talked&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t imagine not asking him where he was from, or whether he had done the killing himself&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t remember the conversation. What I do remember is going home that afternoon and dredging up a man reincarnated as Dari&#x161;a the Bear, a hunter and taxidermist whose obsession with death, drawn from great personal loss, is rooted in his desire to understand and preserve the majesty of things once living. <p></p> I would never have thought, at the outset of all of this, that of all the characters in <em>The Tiger&#x2019;s Wife, </em>I would end up feeling closest to Dari&#x161;a. Perhaps it is because in a roundabout way I have ultimately spent so much time with him; perhaps it is because, in the end, he becomes a man who seeks to capture life in the absence of it. After all, isn&#x2019;t that what storytellers really do? <p></p><p> </p> <p><strong>A Letter from the Author<br></strong></p> <p><strong>T�a Obreht </strong>was born in Belgrade in the former Yugoslavia in 1985 and has lived in the United States since the age of twelve.

It&#x2019;s about encouraging them to open their minds to new challenges, to new opportunities, to who they already are and all they can become. It&#x2019;s about giving them a Yes Brain.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve heard Dan speak, you may have participated in an exercise where he asks his audience to close their eyes and pay attention to their bodily and emotional responses when he repeats a particular word. He begins by somewhat harshly saying &#x201c;no&#x201d; over and over again. He repeats it seven times, then switches to &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; which he says much more gently, again and again. He then asks the audience members to open their eyes and describe what they experienced. They report that the &#x201c;no&#x201d; portion of the exercise left them feeling shut down, upset, tense, and defensive, whereas when Dan repeated the affirming &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; they felt open, calm, relaxed, and lighter. The muscles of their face and vocal cords relaxed, their breathing and heart rate normalized, and they became more open, as opposed to restricted or insecure or oppositional. (Feel free to close your eyes now and try the exercise for yourself. Maybe enlist the help of a relative or friend. Notice what goes on in your body as you repeatedly hear the word &#x201c;no,&#x201d; and then &#x201c;yes.&#x201d;)<br><br>These two different responses&#x2014;�the &#x201c;yes&#x201d; response and the &#x201c;no&#x201d; response&#x2014;�give you an idea of what we mean when we talk about a Yes Brain, as well as its opposite, a No Brain. If you expand that and think about it as an overall outlook on life, a No Brain leaves you feeling reactive when you interact with people, which makes it nearly impossible to listen, make good decisions, or connect with and care for another person. A focus on survival and self-�defense kicks into gear, leaving you feeling guarded and shut down when it comes to interacting with the world and learning new lessons. Your nervous system initiates its reactive fight-�flight-�freeze-�or-�faint response: fight means lashing out, flight means escaping, freeze means temporarily immobilizing yourself, and faint means collapsing and feeling utterly helpless. Any of these four reactive responses to threat can become triggered, preventing you from being open, connecting to others, and offering flexible responses. That&#x2019;s the reactive No Brain state.<br><br>The Yes Brain, in contrast, emerges from different circuits in the brain that become activated and lead to receptivity rather than reactivity. Scientists use the term &#x201c;social engagement system&#x201d; to refer to the set of neural circuits that help us connect openly with others&#x2014;�and even our own inner experience. As a result of receptivity and an active social engagement system, we feel much more capable of addressing challenges in a strong, clear, and flexible way. In this Yes Brain state, we open ourselves to a sense of equanimity and harmony, allowing us to absorb, assimilate, and learn from new information.<br><br>This Yes Brain mindset is what we want for our kids, so that they learn to view obstacles and new experiences not as paralyzing impediments but simply as challenges to be faced and overcome and learned from. When kids work from a Yes Brain mentality, they&#x2019;re more flexible, more open to compromise, more willing to take chances and explore. They&#x2019;re more curious and imaginative, less worried about making mistakes. They&#x2019;re also less rigid and stubborn, which makes them better at relationships and more adaptable and resilient when it comes to handling adversity. They understand themselves and work from a clear internal compass that directs their decisions as well as the way they treat others. Guided by their Yes Brain, they do more, learn more, and become more. They say yes to the world from a place of emotional equilibrium, welcoming all that life offers&#x2014;�even when circumstances don&#x2019;t go their way.<br><br>Our opening message to you is a thrilling one: you have the power to promote this type of flexibility, receptivity, and resilience in your children. This is what we mean by mental strength&#x2014;�giving your kids a strong mind. Not by making them attend a lecture series on grit and curiosity, or by initiating lots of long, intense, stare-�into-�each-�other&#x2019;s-�eyes conversations. In fact, your everyday interactions with your children are all you need. Simply by keeping in mind the Yes Brain principles and lessons we&#x2019;ll show you in the coming pages, you can use the time you spend with your kids&#x2014;�while driving to school, eating dinner, playing together, or even arguing with them&#x2014;�to influence the way they respond to their circumstances and interact with the people around them.<br><br>That&#x2019;s because a Yes Brain is more than just a mindset or an approach to the world. It&#x2019;s that, definitely. And as such, it gives your child an internal guide to help him or her face life&#x2019;s challenges with security and enthusiasm. It&#x2019;s the basis of being strong from the inside out. But a Yes Brain is also a neurological state that emerges when the brain is engaged in certain ways. By understanding a few basic details about brain development, you can help create an environment that provides opportunities that will foster a Yes Brain in your kids.<br><br>As we&#x2019;ll explain below, the Yes Brain is created by neural activity that involves a particular region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, an area that links many regions with one another, handles higher-�order thinking, and facilitates curiosity, resilience, compassion, insight, open-�mindedness, problem-�solving, and even morality. Kids can learn to increasingly access and pay attention to the functions of this part of the brain as they grow and develop. In other words, you can teach your kids how to grow this important neural area that supports mental strength. As a result, they can control their emotions and bodies better, while also listening more carefully to their inner promptings and being more fully themselves. That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re talking about when we discuss the Yes Brain: a neurological state that helps children (and adults) approach the world with openness, resilience, empathy, and authenticity.<br><br>A No Brain, in contrast, emerges less from the interconnecting prefrontal cortex and more from a less integrated brain state that involves the activity of lower, more primitive regions of the brain. This No Brain state is how we respond to a threat or get ready for an impending attack. As a result, it&#x2019;s intensely reactive, defensively worrying that it might make a mistake or that curiosity might lead to some kind of trouble. And this state can go on the offense, too, pushing back on new knowledge and fighting off input from others. Attacking and rejecting are two ways the No Brain deals with the world. The No Brain&#x2019;s outlook on the world is one of stubbornness, anxiety, competition, and threat, leaving it much less capable of handling difficult situations or achieving a clear understanding of self or others.<br><br>Kids who approach the world from a No Brain state are at the mercy of their circumstances and their feelings. They get stuck in their emotions, unable to shift them, and they complain about their realities rather than finding healthy ways to respond to them. They worry, often obsessively, about facing something new or making a mistake, rather than making decisions in a Yes Brain spirit of openness and curiosity. Stubbornness often rules the day in a No Brain state.<br><br>Does any of that sound similar to your situation at home? If you have kids, it probably does. The truth is, we all get into No Brain states&#x2014;�kids and adults alike. Becoming rigid and/or reactive from time to time is something we can&#x2019;t completely avoid. But we can understand it. Then we can learn ways to help our kids return more quickly to a Yes Brain state when they leave it. And more important, we can give them the tools to do so themselves. Young children will work from a No Brain state more often than older children and adults. A seemingly omnipresent No Brain is typical and developmentally appropriate for a three-�year-�old&#x2014;�like when she cries with fury because her harmonica got wet, even though she&#x2019;s the one who threw it in the sink full of water! But over time, and as development unfolds, we can support our kids in developing the ability to regulate themselves, bounce back from difficulties, understand their own �experiences, and be thoughtful of others. Then, more and more, the no becomes a yes.<br><br>Think about that right now, for just a moment. How would life at your house change if your kids were better at responding to everyday situations&#x2014;�conflict with siblings, turning off electronics, following directions, homework struggles, bedtime battles&#x2014;�from a Yes Brain instead of reacting from a No Brain? What would be different if they were less rigid and stubborn and they could better regulate themselves when things don&#x2019;t go their way? What if they welcomed new experiences instead of fearing them? What if they could be clearer about their own feelings, and more caring and empathic toward others? How much happier would they be? How much happier and more peaceful would the whole family be?<br><br>That&#x2019;s what this book is about: helping develop a Yes Brain in your kids by giving them the space, the opportunity, and the tools to develop into people who openly engage with their world and become fully and authentically themselves. This is how we help children develop mental strength and resilience.<br><br>Nurturing a Yes Brain Is Not About Being Permissive<br><br>Let us be clear from the outset about what the Yes Brain is not. The Yes Brain is not about telling kids yes all the time. It&#x2019;s not about being permissive, or giving in, or protecting them from disappointment, or rescuing them from difficult situations. Nor is it about creating a compliant child who robotically minds his parents without thinking for himself. Instead, it&#x2019;s about helping kids begin to realize who they are and who they are becoming, and that they can overcome disappointment and defeat and choose a life full of connection and meaning. Chapters 2 and 3 especially will discuss the importance of allowing children to understand that frustrations and setbacks are an inherent part of life&#x2014;�and supporting them while they learn that lesson.<br><br>After all, the result of a Yes Brain is not a person who is happy all the time or who never experiences any problems or negative feelings. That&#x2019;s not the point at all. It&#x2019;s not the goal of life, nor is it possible. The Yes Brain leads not to some sort of perfection or paradise, but to the ability to find joy and meaning even in the midst of life&#x2019;s challenges. It allows a person to feel grounded and understand themselves, to flexibly learn and adapt, and to live with a sense of purpose. It leads them not only to survive difficult situations, but to emerge from them stronger and wiser. That&#x2019;s how they can develop meaning in their lives. From their Yes Brain they&#x2019;re also able to engage with their inner life, with others, and with the world. That&#x2019;s what we mean by having a life of connection and knowing who we are.<br><br>When kids and adolescents also develop the ability for equanimity&#x2014;�for learning the skill of returning to a Yes Brain state after being in No Brain mode&#x2014;�we&#x2019;ve given them an important components of resilience. The ancient Greeks had a term for this kind of happiness composed of meaning, connection, and peaceful contentedness. They called it eudaimonia, and it&#x2019;s one of the most empowering and lasting gifts we can give our children. It helps create the kind of successful life we can prepare our kids for if we allow them to mature into their own individual identities while supporting them and building skills along the way. And, of course, by working on our own Yes Brain.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s face it: in many ways kids are growing up in a No Brain world. Think about a traditional school day, full of rules and regulations, standardized tests, rote memorization, and one-�size-�fits-�all discipline techniques. Whew! And they have to deal with that six hours a day, five days a week, for nine months of the year? Yikes. On top of that, consider the oh-�so-�packed schedules so many of us impose on them, full of &#x201c;enrichment&#x201d; classes and tutoring and other activities that leave them staying up late and losing sleep because they have to get their homework done because they couldn&#x2019;t do it during the daylight hours since they were so busy being &#x201c;enriched.&#x201d; When we add to this how compelling digital media has become, with auditory and visual stimuli capturing our kids&#x2019; attention around the clock with a temporary pleasure the Greeks called hedonia, we can realize that cultivating a Yes Brain is especially important in these modern times to empower our kids with true and lasting happiness, with the eudaimonia of meaning, connection, and equanimity.<br><br>These digital distractions and busy schedules are often experiences that fail to ignite&#x2014;�and at times even undermine&#x2014;�Yes Brain thought. Some of them may actually offer enriching experiences, and some may be necessary evils (although we&#x2019;re not convinced how necessary certain commonly accepted educational practices really are, as evidenced by the inspirational work being done all over the country and the world by educators who are challenging the status quo in the areas of homework, class schedules, and discipline). Yes, of course kids need to learn about managing routines, following a calendar, and completing tasks that aren&#x2019;t necessarily pleasant or fun. You&#x2019;ll hear us endorse that idea throughout the book. Our main point here is simply that when you consider how many of a child&#x2019;s waking hours are spent doing No Brain work or engaged in No Brain activities, it becomes that much more important that we strive to offer them Yes Brain interactions whenever we possibly can. We want to make home a place where a &#x201c;yes&#x201d; approach is consistently emphasized and prioritized.</p><h2>Record Makers and Breakers: Voices of the Independent Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Pioneers (Music in American Life)</h2><p>This volume is an engaging and exceptional history of the independent rock 'n' roll record industry from its raw regional beginnings in the 1940s with R &amp; B and hillbilly music through its peak in the 1950s and decline in the 1960s.

Humanity was reconciled to God by the Redemption. This does not, however, mean that every individual human being was forthwith justified, for individual justification is wrought by the application to the soul of grace derived from the inexhaustible merits of Jesus Christ. There are two kinds of grace: (1) actual and (2) habitual. Actual grace is a supernatural gift by which rational creatures are enabled to perform salutary acts. Habitual, or, as it is commonly called, sanctifying, grace is a habit, or more or less enduring state, which renders men pleasing to God. This distinction is of comparatively recent date, but it furnishes an excellent principle of division for a dogmatic treatise on grace.</p><p></p><h2>Crazy as a Quilt (A Harriet Turman/Loose Threads Mystery)</h2><p>A quilting conference brings Harriet Truman face-to-face with a past she had been happy to forget.

The only rule was, "come in the house, you get in the photo booth." The result is a diary, a sociology experiment, a documentary of Hollywood, and an exercise in exhibitionism: strippers, Kurt Loder, Marilyn Manson, pizza delivery boys, Rose McGowan, Keanu Reeves, record executives, Scott Ian, Billy Corgan, hookers, Flea, Billy Zane, drug dealers, Angelyne, Leonardo DiCaprio, the cleaning lady, Leif Garrett, Natalie Imbruglia, and everyone else who came into the house are all caught on film&#x2014;whether zany, inebriated, naked, hamming it up, looking beautiful, or looking ugly, the photo booth tells no lies.</p><p>Accompanying the strips are hilarious stories, musings, tell-all anecdotes, and other glimpses into the lifestyle of one of the most decadent rock stars of our time. This chronicle of a year in Navarro's life is also a gritty portrait of his descent into drug use and self-destructiveness, and his struggle to find meaning. Designed by the mad genius who produced Manson's, Motley Crue's and Mankind's books, <em>Don't Try This at Home</em> is a visual masterpiece, a celebrity expos�, and a shocking, hilarious and irresistible read.</p></p><p>Andy Warhol was so enamored with Polaroids that he made special arrangements with the company to purchase all the overstock film of a discontinued model of camera. A similar photographic fetish is the organizing principle of <i>Don't Try This at Home</i>. For kicks, rocker and author Dave Navarro installed a carnival-grade photo booth in his L.A. home. The book documents a year's worth of visitors to Navarro's pad who all stepped into the booth to get their mug shots snapped. <p> The resulting dispatch from Hell is as hard to draw one's eyes from as a twelve car pile-up. Intermingled with a parade of rock stars, models, prostitutes, drug dealers, pizza delivery guys, and housecleaners are a series of observations and interviews with Dave and his co-author Neil Strauss. Strauss, co-author of other tomes for Jenna Jameson, Marilyn Manson, and Motley Crue, operates less as an editor than as a ringmaster to this debauched thing rock stars call a lifestyle. </p><p> <i>Don't Try This At Home</i> is one rollicking contact high of a memoir. Just set it on the coffee table at your home and watch how quickly it snares its readers. <i>-&#x2013;Ryan Boudinot</i></p><p>Dave Navarro racked up four platinum records and three Grammy nominations as the guitarist of Jane's Addiction and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His 2003 marriage to Carmen Electra was captured in MTV's popular reality series, <em>'Til Death Do Us Part: Carmen and Dave</em>. </p><br><br><p>Neil Strauss is the author of the<em> New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>The Game, Rules of the Game, Emergency,</em> and<em> Everyone Loves You When You&#x2019;re Dead</em>. He is also the co-author of three other<em> New York Times</em> bestsellers - Jenna Jameson's <em>How to Make Love Like a Porn Star,</em> M�tley Cr�e's <em>The Dirt</em> and Marilyn Manson's <em>The Long Hard Road out of Hell</em>.

By successfully leapfrogging Japanese forces on that island, he placed his armies in a position to fulfill his personal promise to liberate the Philippines.<br><br>The New Guinea campaign has gone down in history as one of MacArthur's shining successes. Now Stephen Taaffe has written the definitive history of that assault, showing why it succeeded and what it contributed to the overall strategy against Japan. His book tells not only how victory was gained through a combination of technology, tactics, and Army-Navy cooperation, but also how the New Guinea campaign exemplified the strategic differences that plagued the Pacific War, since many high-ranking officers considered it a diversionary tactic rather than a key offensive.<br><br><i>MacArthur's Jungle War</i> examines the campaign's strategic background and individual operations, describing the enormous challenges posed by jungle and amphibious warfare. Perhaps more important, it offers a balanced assessment of MacArthur's leadership and limitations, revealing his reliance on familiar battle plans and showing the vital role that subordinates played in his victory. Taaffe tells how MacArthur played the difficulties of the New Guinea campaign by maintaining his undivided attention on reaching the Philippines. He also discloses how MacArthur frequently deceived both his superiors and the public in order to promote his own agenda, and examines errors the general would later repeat on a larger scale up through the Korean War.<br><br><i>MacArthur's Jungle War</i> offers historians a more analytical treatment of the New Guinea campaign than is found in previous works, and is written with a dramatic flair that will appeal to military buffs. By revealing the interaction among American military planning, interservice politics, MacArthur's generalship, and the American way of war, Taaffe's account provides a clearer understanding of America's Pacific war strategy and shows that the New Guinea offensive was not a mere backwater affair, but a critical part of the war against Japan.</p><p>"Writing with verve and imagination, Taaffe's compelling reassessment of MacArthur's 1944 New Guinea operations brings to life the officers and men behind MacArthur's shining success. Skillfully using the participants' own words to expand our understanding of these complex operations, Taaffe shows how the U.S. Army defeated a stubborn Japanese enemy while fighting in some of the most godforsaken places in the world."--Edward J. Drea, author of <i>MacArthur's ULTRA</i> <p>"Taaffe reexamines one of the great 'forgotten' offensives of World War II. He shows how conflicting egos, interservice rivalries, enemy blunders, and human bravery combined to achieve an important victory in the Pacific war. Along the way he provides insightful portraits of what motivated MacArthur and other U.S. commanders. A vibrant work of military history."--Michael Schaller, author of <i>Douglas MacArthur</i> </p><p>"Taaffe gets underneath the MacArthur facade and looks at a major campaign in all of its important aspects."--Eric M. Bergerud, author of <i>Touched with Fire</i> </p><p>"Will become the standard volume on this neglected subject. It is extremely well written and also presents the most balanced view of MacArthur that I have seen in a long time. A fine piece of work, recommended with enthusiasm."--William M. Leary, author of <i>We Shall Return</i></p>Stephen R. Taaffe teaches history at Trevecca Nazarene College in Nashville.</p><h2>The Wily O&#39;Reilly: Irish Country Stories (Irish Country Books)</h2><p><p>Long before Dr. Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly made most readers' acquaintance in Patrick Taylor's bestselling novel <i>An Irish Country Doctor, </i>he appeared in a series of humorous columns originally published in <i>Stitches: The Journal of Medical Humour</i>. These warm and wryly amusing vignettes provide an early glimpse at the redoubtable Dr. O'Reilly as he tends to the colourful and eccentric residents of Ballybucklebo, a cozy Ulster village nestled in the bygone years of the early sixties.</p><p>Those seminal columns have been collected in <i>The Wily O'Reilly: Irish Country Stories</i>. In this convenient volume, Patrick Taylor's legions of devoted fans can savor the enchanting origins of the Irish Country series . . . and newcomers to Ballybucklebo can meet O'Reilly for the very first time.</p><p>An ex-Navy boxing champion, classical scholar, crypto-philanthropist, widower, and hard-working general practitioner, Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly is crafty and cantankerous in these charming slices of rural Irish life. Whether he's educating a naive man of the cloth in the facts of life, dealing with chronic hypochondriacs and malingerers, clashing with pigheaded colleagues, or raising a pint in the neighborhood pub, the wily O'Reilly knows a doctor's work is never done, even if some of his "cures" can't be found in any medical text!</p></p><p><p>PATRICK TAYLOR, M.D., was born and raised in Bangor, County Down, in Northern Ireland. Dr. Taylor is a distinguished medical researcher, offshore sailor, model-boat builder, and father of two grown children. He is the author of the Irish Country series that began with <i>An Irish Country Doctor</i>. He now lives on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.</p>NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1995 <br> <i>The Lazarus Manoeuvre</i> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>How the young Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly earned the respect of his community</i> <br>We were sitting in the upstairs lounge of Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s house at the end of the day. Himself was tucking contentedly into his second large whiskey. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; he demanded, &#x201c;how do you like it?&#x201d; <br>Being a little uncertain whether he was asking about the spectacular view through the bay window to Belfast Lough, the small sherry I was sipping, or the general status of the universe, I countered with an erudite, &#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>He fished in the external auditory canal of one thickened, pugilist&#x2019;s ear with the tip of his right little finger and echoed my sentiments: &#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>I thought this conversation could become mildly repetitive and decided to broaden the horizons. &#x201c;How do I like what, Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly?&#x201d; <br>He extracted his digit and examined the end with all the concentration and knitting of brows of a gorilla evaluating a choice morsel. &#x201c;Practice here, you idiot. How do you like it?&#x201d; <br>My lights went on. &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I said, as convincingly as possible. &#x201c;Just fine.&#x201d; <br>My reply seemed to satisfy him. He grinned, grunted, hauled his twenty stone erect, wandered over to the sideboard, and returned carrying the sherry decanter. He topped up my glass. &#x201c;A bird can&#x2019;t fly on one wing,&#x201d; he remarked. <br>I refrained from observing that if he kept putting away the whiskey at his usual rate he&#x2019;d soon be giving a pretty fair imitation of a mono-winged albatross in a high gale, accepted my fresh drink, and waited. <br>He returned the decanter, ambled to the window, and took in the scenery with one all-encompassing wave of his arm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d not want to live anywhere else,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Mind you, it was touch and go at the start.&#x201d; <br>He was losing me again. &#x201c;What was, Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fingal, my boy. Fingal. For Oscar.&#x201d; He gave me one of his most avuncular smiles. <br>I couldn&#x2019;t for the life of me see him having been named for a small, gilded statuette given annually to movie stars. &#x201c;Oscar, er, Fingal?&#x201d; I asked. <br>He shook his head. &#x201c;No. Not Oscar Fingal. Wilde.&#x201d; <br>He did this to me. Every time I thought I was following him he&#x2019;d change tack, leaving me in a state of confusion bordering on that usually felt by people recovering from an overdose of chloroform. &#x201c;Oscar Fingal Wilde, Fingal?&#x201d; <br>I should have stuck with &#x201c;Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly.&#x201d; I could tell by the way the tip of his bent nose was beginning to whiten that he was becoming exasperated. He shook his head. &#x201c;Oscar&nbsp;&#x2026; Fingal&nbsp;&#x2026; O&#x2019;Flahertie&nbsp;&#x2026; Wills&nbsp;&#x2026; Wilde.&#x201d; <br>I stifled the urge to remark that if you put an air to it you could sing it. <br>He must have seen my look of bewilderment. The ischaemia left his nose. &#x201c;I was named for him. For Oscar Wilde.&#x201d; <br>The scales fell from my eyes. &#x201c;I see.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good. Now where was I?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You said, &#x2018;It was touch and go at the start.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh yes. Getting the practice going. Touch and go.&#x201d; He sat again in the big comfortable armchair, picked up his glass of whiskey, and looked at me over the brim. &#x201c;Did I ever tell you how I got started?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, settling back in my own chair, preparing myself for another of his reminiscences, for another meander down the byways of O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s life. <br>&#x201c;I came here in the early &#x2019;40s. Took over from Doctor Finnegan.&#x201d; <br>I hoped fervently that we weren&#x2019;t about to embark on the genealogy of James Joyce, and was relieved to hear O&#x2019;Reilly continue, &#x201c;He was a funny old bird.&#x201d; <br>Never, I thought, but kept the thought to myself. <br>O&#x2019;Reilly was warming up now. &#x201c;Just before he left, Finnegan warned me about a local condition of cold groin abscesses. He didn&#x2019;t understand them.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly took a mouthful of Irish, savoured it, and swallowed. &#x201c;He explained to me that when he lanced them he either got wind or shit, but the patient invariably died.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly chuckled. <br>I was horrified. My mentor&#x2019;s predecessor had been incising inguinal hernias. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why it was touch and go,&#x201d; said O&#x2019;Reilly. &#x201c;My first patient had the biggest hernia I&#x2019;ve ever seen. When I refused to lance it, like good old Doctor Finnegan, the patient spread the word that I didn&#x2019;t know my business.&#x201d; He sat back and crossed one leg over the other. &#x201c;Did you ever hear of Lazarus?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oscar Fingal O&#x2019;Flahertie Wills Lazarus?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be impertinent.&#x201d; He grabbed my by-now-empty glass and headed back to the sideboard. The delivery of a fresh libation, and one for himself, signalled that he hadn&#x2019;t been offended. &#x201c;No, the biblical fellow that Jesus raised from the dead.&#x201d; He sat. <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s how I got my start.&#x201d; <br>Was it the sherry or was I really losing my mind? Whatever his skills, I doubted that Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly had actually effected a resurrection. &#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; I asked for it. <br>&#x201c;I was in church one Sunday, hoping that if the citizens saw that I was a good Christian they might look upon me more favourably.&#x201d; <br>The thought of a pious O&#x2019;Reilly seemed a trifle incongruous. <br>&#x201c;There I was when a farmer in the front pew let out a yell like a banshee, grabbed his chest, and keeled over.&#x201d; To add drama to his words O&#x2019;Reilly stood, arms wide. &#x201c;I took out of my pew like a whippet. Examined him. Mutton. Dead as mutton.&#x201d; <br>I knew that CPR hadn&#x2019;t been invented in the &#x2019;40s. &#x201c;What did you do?&#x201d; <br>O&#x2019;Reilly lowered his arms and winked. &#x201c;I got my bag, told everyone to stand back, and gave the poor corpse an injection of whatever came handy. I listened to his heart. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s back,&#x2019; says I. You should have heard the gasp from the congregation.&#x201d; <br>He sat down. &#x201c;I listened again. &#x2018;God,&#x2019; says I, &#x2018;he&#x2019;s going again,&#x2019; and gave the poor bugger another shot.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly sipped his drink. &#x201c;I brought him back three times before I finally confessed defeat.&#x201d; <br>Innocence is a remarkable thing. &#x201c;Did you really get his heart started?&#x201d; <br>O&#x2019;Reilly guffawed. &#x201c;Not at all, but the poor benighted audience didn&#x2019;t know that. Do you know I actually heard one woman say to her neighbour, &#x2018;The Lord only brought Lazarus back once and the new doctor did it three times.&#x2019;&#x201d; He headed for the sideboard again. &#x201c;I told you it was touch and go at the start, but the customers started rolling in after that&#x2014;will you have another?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Ballybucklebo Stories Corp <br></p><h2>Right Choices</h2><p>Best-selling author Kenneth N. Taylor does much more than tell children what is right and wrong in his latest work, <i>Right Choices.</i> He incorporates a solid biblical foundation and illustrations to help young children discern what God says is right and wrong. Each of the 26 spreads begins with a poem and includes pictures, Bible verses, prayers, and text discussing one topic. &#x201c;Wrong&#x201d; topics include lying, cheating, stealing, fighting, and making fun of others. &#x201c;Right&#x201d; topics teach children to honor their parents, talk to God often, be patient, keep promises, and read and obey the Bible.</p><p>Throughout his publishing career, <b>Dr. Kenneth Taylor's</b> dream was for all peoples of the world to read and understand God's Word and experience its power at work in their lives.

They argue that China is laying the groundwork for a sustained challenge to American primacy in maritime Asia, and to defend this hypothesis they look back to Alfred Thayer Mahan s sea-power theories, now popular with the Chinese. The book considers how strategic thought about the sea shapes Beijing s deliberations and compares China s geostrategic predicament to that of the Kaiser s Germany a century ago. It examines the Chinese navy s operational concepts, tactics, and capabilities and appraises China s ballistic-missile submarine fleet. The authors conclude that unless Washington adapts, China will present a challenge to America s strategic position.</p><p>Toshi Yoshihara and James R. Holmes are associate professors of strategy at the Naval War College in Newport, RI. Both authors hold PhDs from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University.Red Star Over the Pacific will be the go-to book on the rise of Chinese sea power. It is spare, yet exhaustive. It is balanced, yet pulls no punches. The clear writing is imbued with the love of subject. Rather than a sterile treatment of naval issues, the book is filled with historical and geographical awareness. Selected by The Atlantic as one of the best books of the year on Foreign Affairs. --Robert D. Kaplan, senior fellow at The Center for a New American Security,<br>The steady and systematic rise of Chinese sea power will soon present a fundamental challenge to the mastery which the U.S. Navy has maintained in the western Pacific for almost seven decades. In this outstanding book, Yoshihara and Holmes provide us with the definitive analysis of an impending revolution in naval affairs, as China extends its capability to control access over all of its littoral seas and Taiwan, and indeed within the entire Pacific first island chain. ... Every American maritime strategist and naval commander will want to read this vitally important book. --James Kurth, Claude C. Smith Professor of Political Science, Emeritus, Swarthmore College<br><br>The shifting strategic balance between the United States and China as Beijing develops the country s seapower will be one of the major issues of the 21st century. While the authors of this thoughtful and expert study show that the motives behind Chinese expansion may not necessarily imply malign intent, and certainly should not automatically be treated that way by Washington, they do show that the United States is bound to be increasingly preoccupied by the consequences of this major challenge. --Geoffrey Till Professor of Maritime Studies, King's College London</p><h2>School, Family, and Community Partnerships: Your Handbook for Action</h2><p><p><strong><em>Strengthen family and community engagement to promote equity and increase student success! &nbsp; </em></strong><br> <br> When schools, families, and communities collaborate and share responsibility for students&#x2032; education, more students succeed in school.

There was an uneasy tension as the slave owners sought to maintain control and keep the slaves working calmly and the abolitionists began to question the moral cost of slavery. The abolitionist movement was growing and for the first time, the souls of the slaves were being considered. As they prepared to compile a special Bible for slaves in the West Indies, the missionaries agreed to uplift the Africans without teaching them anything that could incite rebellion. Throughout history, the Bible has encouraged us to fight against our enslavement to sin, Hell, death, and the grave. But it has also encouraged us to fight against our fellow man who might choose to take our freedom and use us for his own purpose. Just as Egypt enslaved the Jews and used them for labor to build their empire, so were the slaves of Africa used to build the empire of the British West Indies and the United States. Just as Moses stood against the Egyptians and led the children of Israel out of slavery and bondage, so are we encouraged to stand up against the cruel bonds of slavery and fight for our freedom and the freedom of fellow man. The clarion call for human freedom is found in many forms and in various stories throughout the Bible, but all of these ideals were stripped from and carved out of the Slave Bible. The Slave Bible, also called The Negro Bible, is one of the most powerful examples ever witnessed of manipulation using a controlled narrative. The fact that the Christian faith, a religion one-third of the world relied on to bring comfort, spiritual rest, peace, and salvation was the narrative being controlled makes the Slave Bible the ultimate propaganda tool and the greatest lie ever told. </p></p><p></p><h2>Van Halen Rising: How a Southern California Backyard Party Band Saved Heavy Metal</h2><p><p><b><i>A vivid and energetic history of Van Halen&#x2019;s legendary early years</i></b><br><br>After years of playing gigs everywhere from suburban backyards to dive bars, Van Halen led by frontman extraordinaire David Lee Roth and guitar virtuoso Edward Van Halen had the songs, the swagger, and the talent to turn the rock world on its ear. The quartet&#x2019;s classic 1978 debut, <i>Van Halen</i>, sold more than a million copies within months of release and rocketed the band to the stratosphere of rock success. On tour, Van Halen&#x2019;s high-energy show wowed audiences and prompted headlining acts like Black Sabbath to concede that they&#x2019;d been blown off the stage. By the year&#x2019;s end, Van Halen had established themselves as superstars and reinvigorated heavy metal in the process.<br><br>Based on more than 230 original interviews including with former Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony and power players like Pete Angelus, Marshall Berle, Donn Landee, Ted Templeman, and Neil Zlozower <i>Van Halen Rising</i> reveals the untold story of how these rock legends made the unlikely journey from Pasadena, California, to the worldwide stage.</p></p><p><b>Greg Renoff</b> was born in the Bronx, New York, and grew up in New Jersey. Renoff earned his Ph.D. in American history from Brandeis University and is the author of <i>The Big Tent: The Traveling Circus in Georgia, 1820-1930 </i>and <i>Van Halen Rising: How a Southern California Backyard Party Band Saved Heavy Metal. </i>His writing has appeared in <i>Medium.com/Cuepoint</i>, <i>Guitar World</i>, <i>LA Weekly</i> and <i>Vulture</i>, and he and his work have been profiled in <i>Salon</i>, <i>Maxim</i>, and the <i>Boston Herald</i>.&nbsp;He lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with his wife and two daughters.<p> This prehistory is usually glossed over in accounts of the band, but in <i>Van Halen Rising</i>, author Greg Renoff devotes an entire book to it. It&#x2019;s the tale of hardworking kids with nothing in common learning to fuse pop and heavy metal into a new sound that completely changed the music world. It also vividly shows that the personality clashes that would later destroy the band were there from Day One.&#x201d; <i>Rolling Stone</i><br><br> In an excellent new book called <i>Van Halen Rising</i>, author Greg Renoff argues that, in the era of disco and punk, Van Halen&#x2019;s arrival saved heavy metal. While that may be hyperbole, there&#x2019;s little arguing that the backyard party band from Pasadena put Los Angeles back at the center of American rock &amp; roll, where it&#x2019;s largely stayed ever since.&#x201d; <i>LA Weekly</i><br><br> It&#x2019;s a rollicking roll through the life and times of a group that mowed through more groupies and drugs than could possibly be good for a young fella. . . a fascinating read.&#x201d; <i>Pasadena Star News</i><br><br> Renoff explores in depth Van Halen&#x2019;s reluctant journey from back yard band to superstardom and, in particular, the role of David Lee Roth&#x2019;s ambition and entrepreneurial skills.&#x201d; Forbes<br><br> Fascinating (even for non-VH fans) . . . A book almost anthropological in its level of detail.&#x201d; Vulture<br><br> Fans of Van Halen&#x2019;s earliest days. . . are in for a treat next month with the release of Van Halen Rising by American author Greg Renoff.&#x201d; <i>Georgia Straight</i><br><br> Most Van Halen fans have heard about the notorious, alcohol-soaked backyard parties in the Pasadena area that the band played as they built a loyal following but never knew the details. This is where Renoff&#x2019;s exhaustive research and meticulous attention to detail truly pays off. Readers are treated to extensive accounts of these bashes. . . . they can almost feel as if they were actually there. . . . a book that&#x2019;s as entertaining as it is informative.&#x201d; Examiner.com<br><br> Bravo, Mr. Renoff. . . . This is a must-read reference, in the same sense that <i>Women and Children First</i>, <i>Fair Warning</i>, and <i>Diver Down</i> are mandatory listening.&#x201d; <i>Cleveland Music Examiner</i><br><br> Renoff&#x2019;s book is a thoroughly entertaining read that will appeal to every hard rock fan.&#x201d; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> The author draws on interviews with many key players to tell the band&#x2019;s story, and he does a fine job of showing what it must have been like for the members of Van Halen . . . The lack of interviews with Eddie Van Halen and David Lee Roth is notable, but not a serious drawback; many good music biographies have been written about stars who did not actively participate in the writing. And this is a very good one indeed.&#x201d; <i>Booklist</i><br><br> Let us guess you&#x2019;re one of those people who thinks they know everything about Van Halen, right? You don&#x2019;t. At least not until you&#x2019;ve read <i>Van Halen Rising: How a Southern California Backyard Party Band Saved Heavy Metal</i>, the forthcoming book by historian and self-proclaimed Van Halen diehard Greg Renoff.&#x201d; Van Halen News Desk<br><br> I had a blast reading <i>Van Halen Rising</i>. Throughout my teen years, there were few things that meant as much to me as the first six Van Halen albums and the original line up of the band. Greg Renoff takes us back to the beginning of all that, to how Dave, Eddie, Alex, and Michael came to form the group, to what the rock world looked like at the time, and to that grit and commitment it took for them to break through. He also puts us right there in Pasadena, at the backyard parties where the big rock sound was born. If you are a Van Halen fan, a real Van Halen fan, this book is a must read.&#x201d; Brian Koppelman, screenwriter of <i>Rounders</i> and <i>Ocean&#x2019;s Thirteen</i>, director of <i>Solitary Man</i>, and podcaster at <i>The Moment</i><br><br> I thought I knew a lot about Van Halen, until I read this book. It&#x2019;s exceedingly rare to find such a comprehensive portrait of any band&#x2019;s pre-history, even for canonical groups like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin. So to stumble across this level of research about the early days of VH is like hearing studio-quality demos of songs you did not even know existed.&#x201d; Chuck Klosterman, author of <i>Fargo Rock City</i> and <i>Killing Yourself to Live</i><br><br> From the outset of <i>Van Halen Rising</i>, it&#x2019;s clear Greg Renoff reveres the mighty foursome as much as their most ardent fan. With devoted accuracy, Renoff takes us back to the early seventies, when Pasadena kids literally danced in the streets to get a glimpse of their home-town heroes, while music industry execs proclaimed Van Halen had no commercial potential.&#x2019; <i>Van Halen Rising</i> delves into the years of practice and perseverance that led to the overnight success&#x2019; of Van Halen&#x2019;s debut album, one of the most successful in music history. Renoff&#x2019;s writing is consistently punchy and compelling, like Van Halen at its finest. If you&#x2019;ve got it bad, got it bad, got it bad for Van Halen, get <i>Van Halen Rising</i>.&#x201d; Martha Quinn, original MTV VJ, Sirius XM host<br><br> I really loved reading <i>Van Halen Rising</i>. I couldn&#x2019;t believe the insight Renoff has into the production process behind the making of Van Halen&#x2019;s debut. He truly gets it! The book is fantastic.&#x201d; Ted Templeman, Grammy-winning music producer for Van Halen and David Lee Roth<br><br> Greg Renoff&#x2019;s fantastic, immersive new book devotes 350 or so pages to [Van Halen&#x2019;s] early years. . .

It takes you through the teenage rock scene in the LA suburbs of the 1970s, and up to Van Halen&#x2019;s first album, first tours, and then it is done, leaving the rest of the story for others to pick up. And it doesn&#x2019;t disappoint in the process.&#x201d; A Home in Hespeler<br><br> Reading it is like finding some lost demo tape every bit as awesome as Fair Warning, or stumbling on a bitchin&#x2019; Camaro time machine kegger where Jeff Spicoli shows up with his hand in the back pocket of Kim Kelly&#x2019;s bell bottom jeans.&#x201d; The Weaklings<br><br> Renoff&#x2019;s bio is replete with refreshing colour, details and heretofore unheard insight. . .

The perfect gift to make a child feel special&#x2013; like part of the most wonderful family in the world. With a dedication page to commemorate a special occasion and a parent section to help impart their families' unique perspective on the meaning of joining God's family, <i>Water Come Down</i> is a wonderful introduction to the significance of baptism, its roots in the biblical story and its meaning for life today.</p><p>Walter Wangrin Jr. is an internationally known storyteller and the best-selling author of books for children and adults: The Bedtime Rhyme, In The Beginning There Was No Sky, and The Book of God.

He lives in Torreon, Mexico.I am the sun. I am fire and light. I'm the first one At the end of the night Who heard of your naming day. <p>God told me to whisper The news to my sister: A child will be named today. </p><p>God created everything: light and sky and water, sun and moon and stars, vegetable life and animal life---and us. Human beings. </p><p>It would have been fine. All would have been well between us and God and everything else; but sin entered in. Our sin separated us from God. It even grieved creation, as St. Paul says in Romans 8: 'The creations waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God . . . in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay.' </p><p>As in sin, so in grace: all creation is bound together. When God reaches down to love us and to adopt us by Baptism, creation itself rejoices in the 'revealing of the children of God.' </p><p>So I've written a story in which both God and creation delight in a particular child---in your child. And I've drawn upon the rich heritage of Scripture throughout. Each speaker of God's glad word (sun, cloud, rain, wind) also carries a sacred meaning. And the best person to reveal that meaning to your child is you. </p><p>On the following pages I have identified the Bible passages you may use to tell your child the 'rest of the story.' Read the biblical texts by yourself first, then share them with the child in your own words. Talk about their meaning for both of you, children of God through Baptism. Talk about your own experience with these two Baptisms---yours and the child's. </p><p>And here are ways to enhance the settings for your discussions. </p><p>--Bring out memorabilia of the child's Baptism: a baptismal gown, certificate, photographs. --Light a candle---a baptismal candle, if you have one. --Go outside to see and feel the sun, the wind, the rain---or to view a rainbow. --Plant a seed and let the child tend and water it. Together watch it come to new life from its 'grave' in the soil. --Visit your church after services to study the symbols and baptismal font. --And surely, attend Baptisms at church with your child. </p><p>God bless you and your child in this wonderful teaching! ---Walter Wangerin Jr.</p></p><h2>Shaking Things Up: 14 Young Women Who Changed the World</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Each poem and illustration shines with a personality all its own.&#x201d; </strong><strong>&#x2014;</strong><strong><em>Shelf Awareness</em> (starred review)</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;This book has definitely made an impact on my life.&#x201d; </strong><strong>&#x2014;</strong><strong>Kitt Shapiro, daughter of Eartha Kitt</strong></p><p>Fresh, accessible, and inspiring, <em>Shaking Things Up</em> introduces fourteen revolutionary young women&#x2014;each paired with a noteworthy female artist&#x2014;to the next generation of activists, trail-blazers, and rabble-rousers.</p><p>From the award-winning author of <em>Ada&#x2019;s Violin</em>, Susan Hood, this is a poetic and visual celebration of persistent women throughout history. </p><p>In this book of poems, you will find Mary Anning, who was just thirteen when she unearthed a prehistoric fossil.

He claims that removing the underlying conditions that force the body to produce cancerous cells setsthe preconditions for complete healing of our body, mind and emotions.<br><br> This book confronts you with a radically new understanding of cancer - one that revolutionizes the current cancer model. On average, today's conventional treatments of killing, cutting out or burning cancerous cells offer most patients a remission rate of a mere 7 percent, and the majority of these survivors are cured for no more than just five years. Prominent cancer researchers have suggested that individuals may, in fact, fare better undergoing no conventional treatment. Any published success figures in cancer survival statistics are offset by equal or better outcomes among those receiving no treatment at all. More people are killed by cancer treatments than are saved by them.<br><br><i> Cancer Is Not a Disease</i> shows you why traditional cancer&nbsp;treatments and even cancer diagnoses are often fatal, what actually causes cancer, and how you can remove the obstacles that prevent the body from healing itself. Cancer is not an attempt on your life; on the contrary, this "terrible disease" is the body's final, desperate effort to save your life. Unless we change our perception of what cancer really is, it will continue to threaten the life of nearly 1 out of every 2 people. This book opens a door for those who wish to turn feelings of victimhood into empowerment and self-mastery, and disease into health.</p><p>Andreas Moritz was a medical intuitive; a practitioner of Ayurveda, iridology, shiatsu, and vibrational medicine; a writer; and an artist. Born in southwest Germany in 1954, Andreas dealt with several severe illnesses from an early age, which compelled him to study diet, nutrition and various methods of natural healing while still a child.<br><br>By age 20, he completed his training in both iridology (the diagnostic science of eye interpretation) and dietetics. In 1981, he began studying Ayurvedic medicine in India and finished his training as a qualified practitioner of Ayurveda in New Zealand in 1991. Not satisfied with merely treating the symptoms of illness, Andreas dedicated his life's work to understanding and treating the root causes of illness. Because of this holistic approach, he had great success with cases of terminal disease where conventional methods of healing proved futile.<br><br>Starting in 1988, he began practicing the Japanese healing art of shiatsu, which gave him insights into the energy system of the body. In addition, he devoted eight years to researching consciousness and its important role in the field of mind/body medicine.<br><br>Andreas Moritz is the author of the sixteen books on health and spirituality, including <i>The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush</i>, <i>Timeless Secrets of Health &amp; Rejuvenation </i>and&nbsp;<i>Cancer Is Not a Disease.</i><br><br>In October 2012, Andreas transitioned to the Higher Realms. While many people consulted with Andreas on health and emotional issues, they were always moved and inspired by his wisdom. Andreas' legacy comprises a tremendous body of work, which he always generously shared with his readers, colleagues and fans.

In this amazing first-hand narrative, published in 1881, he vividly recounts his early years, which were filled with physical abuse, deprivation, and tragedy; his dramatic escapes to the North, recapture, and eventual freedom; his work for the Anti-Slavery Society and influential role in speaking for other African-Americans; his abolitionist campaigns, and crusade for full civil rights for former slaves.</p><p>This is the first paperback facsimile edition of a work which contributed strongly to the Black people's struggle for freedom and equality. <p>Born in slavery in Maryland in 1817, Frederick Douglass escaped from servitude twenty years later, joined the ranks of the Abolitionists and devoted a long and fruitful life to the winning of freedom for his people. </p><p>Douglass worked with William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips and John Brown, and during the Civil War was so highly regarded by Abraham Lincoln for his contributions to the Union cause that the Great Emancipator called him "the most meritorious person I have ever seen." A fervent integrationist, Douglass was the first of the "freedom riders" and "sit-ins". He felt that true freedom could not come for him until all Blacks were free and equal, and he gave voice and direction to the movement to achieve this goal. </p><p>Told in Frederick Douglass's own words, this volume is an important work of Americana.</p>Frederick Douglass, an outspoken abolitionist, was born into slavery in 1818 and, after his escape in 1838, repeatedly risked his own freedom as an antislavery lecturer, writer, and publisher.</p><h2>Jackson Pollock Splashed Paint And Wasn&#39;t Sorry.</h2><p><p><strong>A clever, charmingly quirky portrayal of painter Jackson Pollock &#x2013; and the first in a series of picture-book biographies of contemporary artists</strong></p><p>Jackson Pollock was unlike any other painter.
